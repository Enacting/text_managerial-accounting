Home Store has grown rapidly this past year, with sales and net income showing significant gains compared to 2011.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_p02">Home Store, Inc., has cash flow problems that are common to many fast growing companies. Although the income statement and balance sheet provide important information concerning financial performance and financial condition, neither statement provides information regarding cash activity for a period of time. The focus of this chapter is on preparing a statement that provides cash flow information. This statement is appropriately called the <em class="emphasis">statement of cash flows</em>.</p>
