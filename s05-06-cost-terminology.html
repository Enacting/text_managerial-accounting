The challenge is in classifying costs correctly for items such as production materials, production labor, marketing department labor, rent for production facilities, and rent for the administrative services facilities. These costs must be classified accurately so that they appear correctly in company financial reports. The starting point for learning how to classify costs correctly is in understanding two broad categories of costs. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are the two broad terms used to categorize cost information in a manufacturing setting?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_p02">Answer: The two broad categories of costs are <em class="emphasis">manufacturing costs</em> and <em class="emphasis">nonmanufacturing costs</em>. Each category is described in detail as follows.</p>
    <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Manufacturing Costs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_p01">All costs related to the production of goods are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">manufacturing costs</a><span class="glossdef">All costs related to the production of goods; also called product costs.</span></span>; they are also referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product costs</a><span class="glossdef">All costs related to the production of goods; also called manufacturing costs.</span></span>. A manufacturer purchases materials, employs workers who use the materials to assemble the goods, provides a building where the materials are stored and goods are assembled, and sells the goods. We classify the costs associated with these activities into three categories: <em class="emphasis">direct materials</em>, <em class="emphasis">direct labor</em>, and <em class="emphasis">manufacturing overhead</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_p02">To help clarify which costs are included in these three categories, let’s look at a furniture company that specializes in building custom wood tables called Custom Furniture Company. Each table is unique and built to customer specifications for use in homes (coffee tables and dining room tables) and offices (boardroom and meeting room tables). The sales price of each table varies significantly, from $1,000 to more than $30,000. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_f01">Figure 1.4 "Direct Materials, Direct Labor, and Manufacturing Overhead at Custom Furniture Company"</a> shows examples of production activities at Custom Furniture Company for each of the three categories (we continue using this company as an example in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a>).</p>

These minor types of materials, often called <em class="emphasis">supplies</em> or <em class="emphasis">indirect materials</em>, are included in manufacturing overhead, which we define later.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_s02_p03">Although selling costs and general and administrative costs are considered nonmanufacturing costs, managers often want to assign some of these costs to products for decision-making purposes. For example, sales commissions and shipping costs for a specific product could be assigned to the product. This does not comply with U.S. GAAP because, under U.S. GAAP, only product costs can be assigned to products. However, as we noted earlier, managerial accounting information is tailored to meet the needs of the users and need not follow U.S. GAAP.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_s02_p04">Distinguishing between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing costs is not always simple. For example, if legal staff works on an issue associated with production personnel and if human resources staff hires assembly line workers, are the costs involved manufacturing or nonmanufacturing costs? It is up to each organization to determine how to handle such costs for product costing purposes. The advantage of managerial accounting over financial accounting is that costs can be organized in any manner that helps managers make decisions. However, in this chapter, to avoid ambiguity, we follow the definitions provided by U.S. GAAP.</p>

All manufacturing costs (direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead) are attached to inventory as an asset on the balance sheet until the goods are sold, at which point the costs are transferred to cost of goods sold on the income statement as an expense.

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">PepsiCo, Inc.,</strong> produces more than 500 products under several different brand names, including Frito-Lay, Pepsi-Cola, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker. Net sales for 2010 totaled $57,800,000,000, resulting in operating profits of $6,300,000,000. Cost of sales represented the highest cost on the income statement at $26,600,000,000. The second highest cost on the income statement—selling and general and administrative expenses—totaled $22,800,000,000. These expenses are period costs, meaning they must be expensed in the period in which they are incurred.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_p06">Examples of selling costs for <strong class="emphasis bold">PepsiCo</strong> include television advertising (probably the biggest piece of the $22,800,000,000), promotional coupons, costs of shipping products to customers, and salaries of marketing and advertising personnel.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_p07">Examples of general and administrative costs include salaries and bonuses of top executives and the costs of administrative departments, including personnel, accounting, legal, and information technology.</p>
