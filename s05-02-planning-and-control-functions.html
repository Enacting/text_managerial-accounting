    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_p02">Answer: The two important functions that enable management to continually plan for the future and assess implementation are called planning and control. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Planning</a><span class="glossdef">The process of establishing goals and communicating these goals to employees of the organization.</span></span> is the process of establishing goals and communicating these goals to employees of the organization.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Continually planning for the future is an important quality of many successful organizations, such as </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Southwest Airlines</em><em class="emphasis"> (discussed in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_n01" xrefstyle="select:label">Note 1.11 "Business in Action 1.1"</a>).</em><em class="emphasis bolditalic"> How do organizations formalize their strategic plans?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p02">Answer: Organizations formalize their plans by creating a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">budget</a><span class="glossdef">A series of reports used to quantify an organization’s plan for the future.</span></span>, which is a series of reports used to quantify an organization’s plans for the future. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">Ernst &amp; Young</strong>, an international accounting firm, plans for the future by establishing a budget indicating the labor hours required to perform specific services for each client. The process of creating a budget for each client enables the firm to plan for future staffing needs and communicate these needs to employees of the company. Rather than simply hoping it all works out in the end, <strong class="emphasis bold">Ernst &amp; Young</strong> projects the labor hours required in the future, hires accounting staff based on these projections, and schedules the staff required for each client.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p03">A budget can take a variety of forms. A budgeted income statement indicates a profit plan for the future. A capital budget shows the long-term investments planned for the future. A cash flow budget outlines cash inflows and outflows for the future. We provide more information about how budgets can be used for planning purposes in later chapters.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p04">Review the annual report or 10K for just about any company, and you are likely to find information regarding plans for the future. Here are some examples:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Southwest Airlines.</strong> A low-fare, short-haul carrier that targets business commuters as well as leisure travelers states in its annual report, “We are focused on four big initiatives: the AirTran integration, the All-New Rapid Rewards program, the addition of the Boeing 737–800 in 2012, and the replacement of our reservations system.”</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sears Holdings Corporation.</strong> A multiline retailer that offers a wide array of merchandise and related services states in its 10K report, “We will continue to invest in our online properties. By integrating our vast store network with our online properties, we believe that Sears Holdings will succeed in the rapidly evolving retail environment.”</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Nordstrom, Inc.</strong> A fashion specialty retailer indicates in its 10K report that its “strategic growth plan includes opening new Nordstrom full-line and Nordstrom Rack stores, with 6 announced Nordstrom full-line and 18 announced Nordstrom Rack store openings, the majority of which will occur by 2012.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p05">As these companies go through the process of making decisions about the future, developing plans based on their decisions, and controlling the implementation of their plans, managerial accounting information will play a key role in all phases of the process.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Answer: The control function evaluates whether an organization’s plans were implemented effectively and often leads to recommendations for the future. Many organizations compare actual results with the initial plan (or budget) to evaluate performance of employees, departments, or the entire organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p03">For example, assume <strong class="emphasis bold">Ernst &amp; Young</strong> creates a budget indicating the labor hours needed to perform tax services for a particular client (this is the <em class="emphasis">planning</em> function). After the work is performed, actual labor hours used to complete the work are compared to budgeted labor hours. This analysis is then used to evaluate whether employees were able to complete the work within the budgeted time and often results in recommendations for the future. Recommendations might include the need for adding more labor hours to the budget or obtaining better support documents from the client.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p04">Planning and controlling operations are critical functions within most organizations. In today’s business environment, effective planning and control by managers can be the key to survival.</p>

                <li>Managers continually plan and control operations within organizations. Planning involves establishing goals and communicating these goals to employees of the organization.

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p05">Assume you are preparing a personal budget of all income and expenses for next month.</p>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_l03" numeration="arabic">
                <li>
                    <p class="para">The planning function would involve establishing income and expense goals for next month. Possible sources of income include wages, scholarships, or student loans. Expenses might include rent, textbooks, tuition, food, entertainment, and transportation.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p06">The control function occurs after the end of the month and involves comparing actual income and expenses with budgeted income and expenses. This allows for the evaluation of whether income and expense goals were achieved.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">There are several benefits to using a planning and control process. The planning function establishes income and expense goals and helps to identify any deviations from these goals. For example, planned expenditures are clearly outlined in the budget and provide guidelines for making expenditure decisions throughout the month. Without clear guidelines, money might be spent on items that are not needed.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p07">The control function allows for an evaluation of how well you met the goals established in the planning process. Perhaps some goals were achieved (e.g., food expenditures were close to what was budgeted) while other goals were not (e.g., transportation expenditures were higher than what was budgeted). The control function identifies these areas and leads to refined goals in the future. For example, the decision might be made to carpool next month to save on transportation costs or to earn more income to pay for transportation by working additional hours.</p>
