    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_p02">Answer: Let’s look at an example of a product line decision. Assume Barbeque Company has three product lines: gas barbecues, charcoal barbecues, and barbecue accessories. Charcoal barbecue sales have declined in recent years, leading management to question whether this product line is worth keeping. Barbeque Company would like to consider two alternatives. Alternative 1 is to retain all three product lines, and Alternative 2 is to eliminate the charcoal barbecues product line. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_f01">Figure 7.4 "Product Line Decision"</a> shows the decision facing the manager at Barbeque Company: whether to eliminate or keep the charcoal barbecue product line.</p>

Direct fixed costs are often differential costs. For example, the salary of the manager responsible for charcoal barbecues is easily traced to the charcoal barbecues product line. If this product line is eliminated, the product line manager’s salary is also eliminated (unless the product line manager has a long-term employment contract).</p>

Allocated fixed costs are typically <em class="emphasis">not</em> differential costs. For example, rent paid for Barbeque Company’s retail store is allocated to all three product lines because it is not easily traced to each product line. However, the retail store rent likely will not decrease if the charcoal barbecues product line is eliminated (unless the company chooses to move to a smaller, less costly store). The charcoal barbecues’ allocation for rent would simply be reallocated to the other two products. Thus rent for the retail store is an example of an allocated fixed cost that is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a differential cost for the two alternatives facing Barbeque Company.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_p09">Answer: Barbeque Company’s total allocated fixed costs of $120,000 are allocated based on sales. Sales revenue for gas barbecues totals $450,000, which is 75 percent of total company sales (= $450,000 ÷ $600,000). Thus 75 percent of all allocated fixed costs are assigned to the gas barbecues product line. This amounts to $90,000 (= $120,000 × 0.75).</p>

However, it saves variable costs of $40,000 and direct fixed costs of $40,000 if it drops the charcoal barbecues product line. Because the $80,000 in cost savings is not enough to make up for the $90,000 loss in sales revenue, profit will decline by $10,000 (= $80,000 − $90,000).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can the charcoal barbecues product line show a loss of $8,000 in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_f03">Figure 7.6 "Product Line Differential Analysis for Barbeque Company"</a>, while the company as a whole is better off keeping this product line?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p02">Answer: The answer lies within allocated fixed costs. Even though total allocated fixed costs of $120,000 cannot easily be traced to each product line, company management wants each product line manager to be aware of these costs. As a result, it uses an allocation process to assign the costs to product lines. Thus the charcoal barbecues product line is assigned $18,000 in allocated fixed costs even though these costs cannot be controlled by the product line. If the charcoal barbecues product line is eliminated, $18,000 in allocated fixed costs is not eliminated. Instead, $18,000 in costs is assigned to the other two product lines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p03">In many situations, this increased allocation to other product lines may cause other product lines to appear unprofitable. The message here is to be careful when analyzing segmented information containing cost allocations. Allocated costs are typically not differential costs, and therefore are typically not relevant to the decision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p04">An alternative view of the decision facing Barbeque Company—whether to keep or drop the charcoal barbecues product line—is simply to calculate profitability of this product line <em class="emphasis">before</em> deducting allocated fixed costs. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_f03">Figure 7.6 "Product Line Differential Analysis for Barbeque Company"</a> shows a contribution margin of $50,000 for charcoal barbecues. Deduct direct fixed costs of $40,000 and this product line has a remaining profit of $10,000. This explains why Barbeque Company’s overall profit would be $10,000 lower if the charcoal barbecues product line were eliminated. (As discussed previously, the allocated fixed costs are irrelevant to this decision.)</p>
