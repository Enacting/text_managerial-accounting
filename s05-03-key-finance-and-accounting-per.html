    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: From the previous discussion, we know that planning and control functions are often designed to evaluate the performance of employees and departments of an organization. This often includes employees overseeing financial information. Thus it is important to understand how most large companies organize their accounting and finance personnel. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are the accounting and finance positions within a typical large company, and what functions do they perform?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_p02">Answer: Let’s look at an example to answer this question. Suppose you are the president of Sportswear Company, mentioned earlier in the chapter, which produces hats and jerseys for fans of professional sports teams. Assume this is a large public company. (The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public company</a><span class="glossdef">A company whose shares of stock are publicly traded.</span></span> refers to a company whose shares of stock are publicly traded—that is, the general investing public can purchase and sell ownership in the company.) As president of Sportswear, you ask the following questions:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_l02" numeration="arabic">
        <li>How much will we owe the government in income taxes for the year?</li>
        <li>What was total net income for the last fiscal year?</li>
        <li>Should we expand into new geographic markets?</li>
        <li>If we do decide to expand into new markets, should we obtain financing by issuing bonds, obtaining a loan from a bank, or issuing common stock?</li>
        <li>How profitable is each segment of our business (hats and jerseys)?</li>
        <li>How effective are our internal controls over cash?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_p03">The challenge is to determine who within Sportswear would be best suited to answer each of these questions. An organization chart will help in finding a solution.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p02">Answer: Smaller organizations tend to have only one or two key finance and accounting personnel who perform the functions described previously. For example, one accountant might perform the financial and managerial accounting duties while another takes care of the tax work (or the tax work might be contracted out to a tax firm). Instead of employing its own internal auditor, an organization might hire one from an outside consulting firm. Some organizations may not have a CFO, or they may have a CFO but not a controller. An organization’s structure depends on many different factors, including its size and reporting requirements, as indicated in the <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_n01">Note 1.23 "Business in Action 1.2"</a>.</p>

            <p class="simpara">The Organizational Structure of a Not-for-Profit Symphony</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p03">Financial limitations prevent a small not-for-profit symphony in California from hiring full-time finance and accounting employees. In spite of having annual revenues approaching $200,000, all financial transactions are processed and recorded by a part-time bookkeeper hired by the symphony. The bookkeeper also inputs budget information and provides monthly financial reports to the treasurer. The treasurer, a volunteer member of the board of directors, is responsible for establishing the annual budget and providing monthly financial reports to the board of directors. An outside firm prepares and processes all tax filings, assembles annual financial statements, and performs a review of the accounting operations at the end of each fiscal year.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p04">Notice how the symphony does not have any of the formal positions identified in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "A Typical Organization Chart"</a>, with the exception of the treasurer. This illustrates how financial constraints and reporting requirements may require an organization to be creative in establishing its organizational structure.</p>
