    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_p01">Sandy Masako is the CEO of a fast-food restaurant called Chicken Deluxe. The company operates hundreds of restaurants throughout North America and is choosing between two suppliers of soft drinks: Deep Fizz Company and Extreme Fizz, Inc. Consumer surveys indicate no significant preference between the two. Sandy is meeting with Dave Roberts, the CFO, and Karen Kraft, the purchasing manager, to discuss the company’s options.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_p02">Chicken Deluxe is facing a supplier decision common to many companies. Financial stability is an important factor in deciding on a supplier, along with the quality of product and reliability of service. Chicken Deluxe must analyze financial information for Deep Fizz and Extreme Fizz to determine the financial condition of each company.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_p03">The analysis of a company’s financial information typically follows a three-pronged approach. First, trends within a company’s own financial information are analyzed, such as sales and earnings from one year to the next, using two methods—<em class="emphasis">trend analysis</em> and <em class="emphasis">common-size analysis</em>. Second, financial measures are compared between competitors. Finally, financial ratios are compared to industry averages. We discuss these three approaches next using <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> as an example. We will revisit the decision facing Chicken Deluxe later in the chapter.</p>
