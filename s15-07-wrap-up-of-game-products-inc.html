    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s07_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: At the meeting described at the beginning of the chapter between Mandy Dwyer (president and CEO) and Larry Meske (CFO), Mandy wanted to revise the compensation plan for the manager of the Board Games division to increase her bonus because profits had increased significantly compared to prior years. Larry suggested using measures other than segmented net income to evaluate each division and asked for time to gather additional information. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What information did Larry gather, and how does this additional information help Mandy evaluate each division?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s07_p02">Answer: Larry assembled the information using the five methods of evaluating investment centers presented in this chapter: (1) segmented net income, (2) profit margin ratio, (3) return on investment (ROI), (4) residual income (RI), and (5) economic value added (EVA). These five measures have been calculated for each division of Game Products, Inc., and are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s07_f01">Figure 11.11 "Five Performance Measures at Game Products, Inc."</a>.</p>

U.S. GAAP requires these costs to be expensed when incurred. EVA suggests recording R&amp;D costs as an asset and amortizing the costs over the useful life of R&amp;D activities. Since Computer Games has much higher R&amp;D costs than the other divisions, the numbers changed dramatically relative to the other divisions. Also, after-tax income is used rather than operating income, and average assets are adjusted as well.</em></td>

They are widely used in industry, and managers tend to understand the nature of these measures. The last two measures are also useful and should not be overlooked.
