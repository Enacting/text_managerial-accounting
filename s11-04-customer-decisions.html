    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_p02">Answer: Instead of tracing revenues, variable costs, and fixed costs directly to <em class="emphasis">product lines</em>, we track this information by <em class="emphasis">customer</em>. Fixed costs that cannot be traced directly to customers are allocated to customers. Let’s look at an example for a company called Colony Landscape Maintenance to identify the similarities and differences between the two formats.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluating Customer Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Colony Landscape Maintenance provides services to three large customers: Brumfield, Hodges, and Orth. The segmented income statement in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_f01">Figure 7.9 "Income Statement for Colony Landscape Maintenance"</a> provides annual revenue and cost information by customer. Notice that this information is formatted similarly to the product line information in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_f01">Figure 7.8 "Differential Analysis with Opportunity Cost for Barbeque Company"</a>. However, instead of tracking information by product line, here we track information by customer. Examine <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_f01">Figure 7.9 "Income Statement for Colony Landscape Maintenance"</a> carefully and notice that the Brumfield account shows a loss for the year of $15,000. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Should Colony Landscape Maintenance drop the Brumfield account?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p02">Answer: To answer this question we must take a closer look at the information in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_f01">Figure 7.9 "Income Statement for Colony Landscape Maintenance"</a>. The variable costs and direct fixed costs are related directly to each customer, and thus are eliminated if Colony eliminates the Brumfield account. That is, all variable costs and direct fixed costs are differential costs for the two alternatives facing Colony. Colony assigns the allocated fixed costs of $20,000 to Brumfield based on sales revenue, and those costs will continue regardless of Colony’s decision. Thus allocated fixed costs are <em class="emphasis">not</em> differential costs.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p03">Management of Colony Landscape Maintenance would like to know if dropping the Brumfield account would increase overall company profit. The differential analysis presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_f02">Figure 7.10 "Customer Differential Analysis for Colony Landscape Maintenance"</a> provides the answer. Panel A shows the income statement for Alternative 1: keeping all three customers. Panel B shows the income statement for Alternative 2: dropping the Brumfield account. And panel C presents the differential analysis for both alternatives. The differential analysis presented in panel C shows that overall profit will decrease by $5,000 if Colony drops the Brumfield account.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p06">An alternative way of handling the decision facing Colony Landscape Maintenance is simply to calculate profitability of the Brumfield account <em class="emphasis">before</em> deducting allocated fixed costs. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_f04">Figure 7.12 "Summary of Differential Analysis for Colony Landscape Maintenance"</a> shows a contribution margin of $30,000 for the Brumfield account. Deduct direct fixed costs of $25,000 and the customer has a remaining profit of $5,000. This explains why Colony’s overall profit would be $5,000 lower if it eliminated the Brumfield account.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Engineering Firm Fires Its Biggest Customer</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p07">The president of <strong class="emphasis bold">ABCO Automation, Inc.</strong>, a 120-person engineering firm in North Carolina, decided it was time to fire the firm’s biggest client. Although the client provided close to 60 percent of the firm’s annual revenue, <strong class="emphasis bold">ABCO</strong> decided that firing this client was necessary. The president of <strong class="emphasis bold">ABCO</strong> stated, “We cannot be a great place to work without employees, and this client was bullying my employees. Its demands for turnaround were impossible to meet even with people working seven days a week. No client is worth losing my valued employees.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p08">The initial impact on revenues was significant. However, <strong class="emphasis bold">ABCO</strong> was able to cut costs and obtain new customers to fill the void. In addition, the fired client later gave <strong class="emphasis bold">ABCO</strong> two new projects on more equitable terms.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p09">The lesson from this is that dropping customers is not always a financial decision. <strong class="emphasis bold">ABCO’s</strong> client was profitable, but in the long run, the firm was at risk of losing valuable employees.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Activity-based costing, which we discussed in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch03#heisinger_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "How Does an Organization Use Activity-Based Costing to Allocate Overhead Costs?"</a>, is a refined approach to allocating costs to products or customers. Activity-based costing first assigns costs to activities and then to products or customers based on their use of the activities. The cost information provided by activity-based costing is generally regarded as more accurate than most traditional costing methods. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can using activity-based costing information with differential analysis lead to better decisions in areas such as product lines and customer profitability?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p02">Answer: Let’s look at a brief example of how activity-based costing can help with customer profitability. When assessing customer profitability, costs can be assigned to customers based on each customer’s use of activities. Consultants from <strong class="emphasis bold">PricewaterhouseCoopers</strong> suggest that customer costs are measurable across four categories of activities:<span class="footnote" id="heisinger_1.0-fn07_001">Joseph A. Ness, Michael J. Schroeck, Rick A. Letendre, and Willmar J. Douglas, “The Role of ABM in Measuring Customer Value—Part 2,” <em class="emphasis">Strategic Finance</em> (April 2001): 44–49.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p03">With the help of activity-based costing, costs can be assigned to activities within each category. These costs are then allocated to customers based on each customer’s use of activities. A significant advantage of using activity-based costing is having accurate data for decision-making purposes, particularly in the area of differential analysis.</p>
