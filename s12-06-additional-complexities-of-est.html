However, there are two additional items related to estimating cash flows that must be considered: investment cash outflows and working capital. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do these two items impact long-term investment decisions?</em></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Investment Cash Outflows</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s06_s01_p01">The examples thus far have assumed that cash outflows for the investment occur only at the beginning of the investment. However, some investments require cash outflows at varying points throughout the life of the project. For example, suppose the <strong class="emphasis bold">JCPenney Company</strong> plans to open a new store, which requires a $10,000,000 investment at the beginning of the project for construction of the building. However, the building will be expanded at the end of year 4, at a cost of $2,000,000, to meet an expected increase in demand. The $2,000,000 cash outflow must be included in the cash flows of the project for year 4 when calculating the NPV, IRR, and payback period.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s06_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Working capital</a><span class="glossdef">Current assets minus current liabilities.</span></span> is defined as current assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and the like) minus current liabilities (accounts payable, wages payable, and accrued liabilities, for instance). Many long-term investments require working capital. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">JCPenney</strong> will need cash in its registers when it opens the new store. Working capital is also required to fund inventory and accounts receivable. Working capital necessary for long-term investments should be included as a cash outflow, typically at the beginning of the project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s06_s02_p02">Some long-term investments have an expected life, at the end of which working capital is returned to the company for investment elsewhere. When this happens, the working capital is included in the cash flow analysis as a cash <em class="emphasis">outflow</em> at the beginning of the project and a cash <em class="emphasis">inflow</em> at the end of the project.</p>

Simply calculate how many months are required in year 5 to recover the remaining $90,000. $90,000 divided by $160,000 equals 0.56 (rounded). Thus 0.56 of a year, or approximately 7 months (= 0.56 × 12 months), is required to recover the remaining $90,000.
