        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_p01">Assume Tony’s T-shirts makes shirts for local soccer, baseball, basketball, and other sports teams. The owner, Tony, purchases the shirts and prints graphics on the shirts for each team. The graphics were designed several years ago, so design costs are no longer incurred. On average, Tony sells 1,000 shirts each month. Typical monthly financial data follow:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_p02">The monthly information provided relates to the company’s routine monthly operations. A representative of the local high school recently approached Tony to ask about a one-time special order. The high school will be hosting a statewide track and field event and is willing to pay Tony’s T-shirts $17 per shirt to make 200 custom T-shirts for the event. Because enough idle capacity exists to handle this order, it will not affect other sales. That is, Tony has the factory space and machinery available to produce more T-shirts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_p03">Tony incurs the same variable costs of $13 per unit to produce the special order, and he will pay a firm $600 to design the graphics that will be printed on the shirts. This special order will have no other effect on Tony’s monthly fixed costs.</p>

As shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_f01">Figure 7.13 "Special Order Differential Analysis for Tony’s T-Shirts"</a>, Alternative 1 assumes Tony rejects the special order, and Alternative 2 assumes he accepts the special order. The differential analysis in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_f01">Figure 7.13 "Special Order Differential Analysis for Tony’s T-Shirts"</a> shows that Tony’s would be better off accepting the special order, as profit increases $200.</p>

If Tony’s T-shirts accepts the special order, sales revenue will increase $3,400 with a corresponding increase in variable costs of $2,600. Fixed costs will increase by $600 because design work is required for the special order. Thus profit will increase by $200 (= $3,400 − $2,600 − $600).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Special Order Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What assumptions were made with the differential analysis performed for Tony’s T-shirts?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s02_p02">Answer: We made two important assumptions in the Tony’s T-shirts special order example. The first assumption is that Tony’s has enough idle capacity to handle the order without disrupting regular customer orders. Suppose Tony’s T-shirts is operating at capacity and cannot produce any more T-shirts. Tony must turn away regular customers to make room for the special order. In this scenario, the opportunity cost of turning away existing customers must be considered in the differential analysis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s02_p03">The second assumption is that this is a one-time order, and therefore represents a short-run pricing decision. If Tony’s T-shirts expects future orders from the high school at the $17 per shirt price, the company must consider the impact this might have on long-run pricing with other customers. That is, regular customers may hear of this special price and demand the same price, particularly those customers who have been loyal to Tony’s T-shirts for many years. Tony’s might be forced to lower prices for regular customers, thereby eroding the company’s profits over time. The key point is that companies evaluating special orders can drop prices in the short run to cover differential variable and fixed costs. But in the long run, prices must cover all variable and fixed costs.</p>
