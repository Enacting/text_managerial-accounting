Recall that Best Boards produces each wakeboard for $110, and Jim Muller, vice president of operations, received a bid for $70 per board from an outside manufacturer. Best Boards’ president asked the company’s accountant, Amy Eckstrom, to investigate whether it makes sense for Best Boards to hire an outside company to produce the wakeboards. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What information should Amy provide that will help management make this decision?</em></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p02">Answer: After further research, Amy identified the following product costs associated with wakeboard production at Best Boards:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_11/e0ec249c37525b1a2ed7cc870bee6535.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p03">Since Best Boards produces 10,000 wakeboards each year, the product cost per unit is $110 (= $1,100,000 ÷ 10,000 units). However, Amy must identify which of the costs listed previously are <em class="emphasis">differential</em> costs if the company acquires the wakeboards from an outside producer. That is, Amy must determine which costs will change and which will remain the same. Here’s what she found:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>All variable production costs will be eliminated if Best Boards buys the wakeboards rather than making them. These are differential costs.</li>
            <li>The factory equipment lease will continue for several years whether Best Boards makes or buys the wakeboards. This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a differential cost.</li>
            <li>The factory building lease covers several years, so this cost will continue whether Best Boards makes or buys the wakeboards. This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a differential cost.</li>
            <li>One of Best Boards’ two production supervisors was hired recently, is paid $50,000 per year, and can be let go if needed. This is a differential cost.</li>
            <li>The other of Best Boards’ two production supervisors has been with the company for several years, is paid $90,000 per year, and has five years remaining on her contract. This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a differential cost.</li>

Her analysis appears in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_f01">Figure 7.2 "Make-or-Buy Differential Analysis for Best Boards, Inc."</a>. Because the focus of make-or-buy decisions is on product costs, and because sales revenue is not differential to this decision, it is not necessary to include sales revenue in the analysis.

Also, one of our factory supervisors has a long-term contract for $90,000 per year and cannot be let go any time soon. None of these costs can be eliminated if we outsource production.
