        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_p02">Answer: Sales of $900,000 shown on the income statement do not represent cash collected from sales. The adjustment rule used to convert sales to cash receipts from customers is as follows: increases in accounts receivable are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from sales revenue, and conversely, decreases in accounts receivable are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to sales revenue. Since accounts receivable for Home Store, Inc., increased $60,000, a deduction of $60,000 from sales revenue must be taken to find cash receipts from customers. Thus cash receipts from customers totaled $840,000 (= $900,000 sales − $60,000 increase in accounts receivable). The accounts receivable T-account shown in the following further clarifies this concept.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s06_s02_p02">Answer: Two adjustments must be made to cost of goods sold to calculate cash paid to suppliers. First, increases in inventory are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to cost of goods sold, and conversely, decreases in inventory are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from cost of goods sold. Since inventory for Home Store, Inc., increased $66,000, cost of goods sold is increased $66,000. Second, increases in accounts payable are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from cost of goods sold, and conversely, decreases in accounts payable are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to cost of goods sold. Since accounts payable increased $1,000, cost of goods sold is decreased $1,000. These 2 adjustments result in cash paid to suppliers of $611,000 (= $546,000 cost of goods sold + $66,000 increase in inventory − $1,000 increase in accounts payable).</p>

First, increases in prepaid expenses are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to operating expenses, and conversely, decreases in prepaid expenses are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from operating expenses. Since prepaid expenses for Home Store, Inc., decreased $2,000, operating expenses are decreased $2,000. Second, increases in accrued liabilities are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from operating expenses, and conversely, decreases in accrued liabilities are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to operating expenses. Home Store, Inc., does not have any accrued liabilities and, therefore, no adjustment is necessary for accrued liabilities. The 1 adjustment to operating expenses at Home Store, Inc., results in cash payments for operating expenses of $118,000 (= $120,000 selling and administrative expenses − $2,000 decrease in prepaid expenses).</p>
