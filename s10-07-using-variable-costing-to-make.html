Under U.S. GAAP, all nonmanufacturing costs (selling and administrative costs) are treated as period costs because they are expensed on the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. All costs associated with production are treated as product costs, including direct materials, direct labor, and fixed and variable manufacturing overhead. These costs are attached to inventory as an asset on the balance sheet until the goods are sold, at which point the costs are transferred to cost of goods sold on the income statement as an expense. This method of accounting is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">absorption costing</a><span class="glossdef">A costing method that includes all manufacturing costs (fixed and variable) in inventory until the goods are sold.</span></span> because <em class="emphasis">all</em> manufacturing overhead costs (fixed and variable) are <em class="emphasis">absorbed</em> into inventory until the goods are sold.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s01_p02">Answer: Since absorption costing includes fixed manufacturing overhead as a product cost, all products that remain in ending inventory (i.e., are unsold at the end of the period) include a portion of fixed manufacturing overhead costs as an asset on the balance sheet. Since variable costing treats fixed manufacturing overhead costs as period costs, all fixed manufacturing overhead costs are expensed on the income statement when incurred. Thus if the quantity of units produced exceeds the quantity of units sold, absorption costing will result in higher profit.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s01_s01_p03">As you review <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.9 "Number of Units Produced Equals Number of Units Sold"</a>, notice that when the number of units produced equals the number sold, profit totaling $90,000 is identical for both costing methods. With absorption costing, fixed manufacturing overhead costs are fully expensed because all units produced are sold (there is no ending inventory). With variable costing, fixed manufacturing overhead costs are treated as period costs and therefore are always expensed in the period incurred. Because all other costs are treated the same regardless of the costing method used, profit is identical when the number of units produced and sold is the same.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages of Using Variable Costing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do organizations use variable costing?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p02">Answer: Variable costing provides managers with the information necessary to prepare a contribution margin income statement, which leads to more effective cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis. By separating variable and fixed costs, managers are able to determine contribution margin ratios, break-even points, and target profit points, and to perform sensitivity analysis. Conversely, absorption costing meets the requirements of U.S. GAAP, but is not as useful for internal decision-making purposes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p03">Another advantage of using variable costing internally is that it prevents managers from increasing production solely for the purpose of inflating profit. For example, assume the manager at Bullard Company will receive a bonus for reaching a certain profit target but expects to be $15,000 short of the target. The company uses absorption costing, and the manager realizes increasing production (and therefore increasing inventory levels) will increase profit. The manager decides to produce 20,000 units in month 4, even though only 10,000 units will be sold. Half of the $40,000 in fixed production cost ($20,000) will be included in inventory at the end of the period, thereby lowering expenses on the income statement and increasing profit by $20,000. At some point, this will catch up to the manager because the company will have excess or obsolete inventory in future months. However, in the short run, the manager will increase profit by increasing production. This strategy does not work with variable costing because all fixed manufacturing overhead costs are expensed as incurred, regardless of the level of sales.</p>

This brewpub was to be called Roseville Brewing Company (RBC).</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p68">Brewpubs provide two products to customers: food from the restaurant segment, and freshly brewed beer from the beer production segment. Both segments are typically in the same building, which allows customers to see the beer brewing process.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p69">After months of research, the three entrepreneurs created a financial model that showed the following projections for the first year of operations:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p70">In the process of pursuing capital (cash) through private investors and financial institutions, they were asked several questions. The following is a sample of the questions most commonly asked:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_l56">
                        <li>What is the break-even point?</li>
                        <li>What sales dollars will be required to make $200,000? To make $500,000?</li>
                        <li>Is the product mix reasonable? (Beer tends to have a higher contribution margin ratio than food, and therefore product mix assumptions are critical to profit projections.)</li>
                        <li>What happens to operating profit if the product mix shifts?</li>
                        <li>How will changes in price affect operating profit?</li>
                        <li>How much does a pint of beer cost to produce?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s07_s02_p71">It became clear that the initial financial model was not adequate for answering these questions. After further research, the entrepreneurs created another financial model that provided the following information for the first year of operations. (Notice that operating profit of $302,212 is the same as in the first model.)</p>
