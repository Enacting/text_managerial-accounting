These companies simply record the cost of the purchase in an inventory account and account for any returns and allowances, discounts, and shipping costs. Once the merchandise is sold, the related inventory costs are transferred to cost of goods sold. However, manufacturing companies are different. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do manufacturing companies account for inventory at different stages of production?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s01_p02">Answer: Manufacturing companies like Custom Furniture Company, <strong class="emphasis bold">Ford</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">IBM</strong> don’t have it quite as easy as merchandising companies. They must account for the materials, labor, and other manufacturing costs that go into building the product. The process of accounting for manufacturing costs depends on which costing system a company uses—job costing or process costing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Answer: A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">job costing system</a><span class="glossdef">A system that records revenues and costs for each job.</span></span> records revenues and costs for each job. Because each job at Custom Furniture Company results in a unique product and has different material and labor requirements, the company uses a job costing system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p03">Tracking revenues and costs for each job is important for several reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Like Dan at Custom Furniture, managers want to assess the accuracy of cost estimates. This is particularly important when prices are based on estimated costs.</li>
            <li>Managers want to review actual revenues and costs for each job to see if the job is profitable.</li>
            <li>Managers want to compare actual costs with estimated costs throughout a project so they can identify unexpected changes as early in the project as possible. For example, if the cost of mahogany wood increases by 50 percent, Custom Furniture might renegotiate the price of a mahogany table with the customer. If it’s too late to renegotiate the price of a current job, the cost increase could be built into the pricing of future jobs.</li>
