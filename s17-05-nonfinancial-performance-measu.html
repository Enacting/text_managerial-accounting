    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Although financial measures are important for evaluation purposes, many organizations use a mix of financial and nonfinancial measures to evaluate performance. For example, airlines track on-time arrival percentages carefully, and delivery companies like </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Federal Express (FedEx) </em><em class="emphasis">and </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">United Parcel Service (UPS) </em><em class="emphasis">monitor percentages of on-time deliveries. The balanced scorecard uses several alternative measures to evaluate performance. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is a balanced scorecard and how does it help companies to evaluate performance?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balanced scorecard</a><span class="glossdef">A balanced set of financial and nonfinancial measures used by organizations to motivate employees and evaluate performance.</span></span> is a balanced set of measures that organizations use to motivate employees and evaluate performance. These measures are typically separated into four perspectives outlined in the following. (Dr. Robert S. Kaplan and Dr. David P. Norton created the balanced scorecard, and it is actively promoted through their company, Balanced Scorecard Collaborative. More information can be found at the company’s Web site at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bscol.com">http://www.bscol.com</a>.)</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_l02" numeration="arabic">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Financial.</strong> Measures that shareholders, creditors, and other stakeholders use to evaluate financial performance.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Internal business process.</strong> Measures that management uses to evaluate efficiency of existing business processes.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Learning and growth.</strong> Measures that management uses to evaluate effectiveness of employee training.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customer.</strong> Measures that management uses to evaluate whether the organization is meeting customer expectations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p03">The goal is to link these four perspectives to the company’s strategies and goals. For example, a high percentage of on-time arrivals is likely an important goal from the perspective of the <em class="emphasis">customer</em> of an airline. A high percentage of defect-free computer chips is likely an important goal from the <em class="emphasis">internal business process</em> perspective of a computer chip maker. A high number of continuing education hours is likely an important goal from the <em class="emphasis">learning and growth</em> perspective for tax personnel at an accounting firm. Measures from a <em class="emphasis">financial</em> perspective were covered earlier in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p04">Companies that use the balanced scorecard typically establish several measures for each perspective. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_t01">Table 13.4 "Balanced Scorecard Measures"</a> lists several examples of these measures.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p05">Measures established across the four perspectives of the balanced scorecard are linked in a way that motivates employees to achieve company goals. For example, if the company wants to increase the defect-free rate and reduce product returns, effective employee training and low employee turnover will help in achieving this goal. The idea is to establish company goals first, then create measures that motivate employees to reach company goals.</p>

            <li>Most organizations use a mix of financial and nonfinancial measures to evaluate performance. The balanced scorecard approach uses a balanced set of measures separated into four perspectives—financial, internal business process, learning and growth, and customer. The last three perspectives tend to include nonfinancial measures, such as hours of employee training or number of customer complaints, to evaluate performance. The goal is to link financial and nonfinancial measures to the company’s strategies and goals.</li>
