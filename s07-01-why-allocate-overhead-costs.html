    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Recall that costs for direct labor and direct materials are easily traced to products. When SailRite produces a sailboat, the direct materials include items such as fiberglass to build the hull, mast, sails, and rope. Direct labor includes the employees building the boat. Accounting for these costs is fairly simple. Indirect manufacturing costs (also called manufacturing overhead or overhead) include electricity to run the factory, rent for the factory building, and factory maintenance. These costs are not easily traced to products and pose a much more complicated challenge for SailRite. Accounting for indirect manufacturing costs typically requires allocating overhead using predetermined overhead rates. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do managers insist on allocating overhead costs to products?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s01_p02">Answer: Three important reasons that managers allocate overhead costs to products are described in the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Provide information for decision making.</strong> Setting prices for products is one example of a decision that must be made by management. Prices are often established based on the cost of products. It is not enough to simply include direct materials and direct labor. Overhead must be considered as well.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promote efficient use of resources.</strong> Several different activities are performed to produce a product, such as purchasing raw materials, setting up production machinery, inspecting the final product, and repairing defective products. All of these activities consume resources (consuming resources is another way of stating that a cost is associated with each of these activities). If products are charged for the use of these activities, managers will have an incentive to be efficient in utilizing the activities.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP).</strong> U.S. GAAP requires that all manufacturing costs—direct materials, direct labor, and overhead—be assigned to products for inventory costing purposes. This requires the allocation of overhead costs to products.</li>
    </ul>

            <li>Overhead costs are allocated to products to provide information for internal decision making, to promote the efficient use of resources, and to comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.</li>
