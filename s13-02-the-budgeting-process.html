These budgets are imposed on the organization and do little to motivate employees or to gain acceptance by employees. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What method of budgeting is more effective than the top-down approach?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02_p02">Answer: Successful companies approach budgeting from the bottom up. This requires the involvement of various employees within the organization, not just upper management. Lower-level employees often know more about their functional areas than upper management, and they can be an excellent source of information for budgeting purposes. Although getting input from employees throughout the organization can be time consuming, this approach tends to increase employee motivation and acceptance of the budget.</p>

            <li>Some companies take a top-down approach to budgeting (upper management establishes the budget with little input from others), while other companies take a bottom-up approach (lower level employees are involved in the budgeting process). The bottom-up approach tends to be more effective as employees are more inclined to accept the budget. Regardless of the approach used, the budget committee (made up of a group within the organization) is responsible for overseeing and approving the master budget.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02_l04" numeration="arabic">
            <li>A master budget is a series of budget schedules outlining the organization’s plans for the upcoming period, typically prepared monthly, quarterly, or annually. The master budget includes budgets for sales, production, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Managers use this information to create budgeted financial statements (income statement, cash flows, and balance sheet).</li>
            <li>The bottom-up approach requires involvement of employees throughout the organization, not just upper management, to create the operating budget. Successful companies use this approach because lower-level employees tend to know more about their functional areas than upper management, providing for more accurate budget information. Also, employee involvement in the budget process increases the likelihood employees will accept the budget.</li>
