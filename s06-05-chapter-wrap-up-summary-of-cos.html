    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_p02">Answer: Companies must be able to evaluate the profitability of each job and on a broader scale, evaluate the overall profitability of the company. This requires that all manufacturing and nonmanufacturing costs be classified and recorded correctly in the general journal.

(Note that each entry shows the total dollar amount for the month rather than individual transaction amounts.) If you understand how to make an entry summarized in total, you know how to make each individual (perhaps daily) entry. Beginning balances for raw materials inventory ($25,000), work-in-process inventory ($35,000), and finished goods inventory ($90,000) are shown in the T-accounts in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_f02">Figure 2.8 "Custom Furniture Company’s T-Accounts"</a>. Although it is not necessary to refer back to <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a> at this point, we should note that the beginning balance and transaction amounts used here for these three inventory accounts tie back to the three schedules presented in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a> (schedule of raw materials placed in production, schedule of cost of goods manufactured, and schedule of cost of goods sold).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s02_p01">Recall from the beginning of the chapter that Dan Stevens, the owner of Custom Furniture Company, is concerned about the company’s profitability. Although Dan prices his furniture at 70 percent above estimated production costs, the company had only $11,000 in profits for the month of May, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_f03">Figure 2.9 "Custom Furniture Company’s Income Statement"</a>. Dan asked Leslie (the accountant) to look into the accuracy of his estimates by reviewing actual production costs for the three costliest tables produced in May. As you read Leslie’s comments, be sure to look at the income statement in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_f03">Figure 2.9 "Custom Furniture Company’s Income Statement"</a> and the job cost estimates and actual results in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s02_f01">Figure 2.10 "Job Cost Estimates Versus Actual Results for Custom Furniture Company"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s02_p03">Answer: This information helps managers assess the profitability of individual jobs. Custom Furniture Company was able to identify areas of concern by comparing information from job cost sheets with Dan’s estimates. Dan and Leslie will have to do more research to find the cause of the high material costs. If changes cannot be made to the production process to reduce these costs, Dan may have to consider revising his estimates and raising prices on future jobs. The goal is to provide enough information for the company to make informed decisions about areas of concern, such as direct materials costs, and how much to charge for future jobs.</p>
