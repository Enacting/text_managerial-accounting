    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_p02">Answer: The starting point for evaluating investment centers is typically with reviewing segmented income for each investment center (or division). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Segmented income</a><span class="glossdef">Segment (or division) revenues minus segment expenses.</span></span> is segment revenues minus segment expenses. Top management is interested in the level of profit that each division generates, and segmented income gives them this information.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p03">Although this income statement looks much like a financial accounting income statement prepared for outside users, it is for internal use and therefore, need not comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). In fact, organizations can define income or profit many different ways when evaluating performance. For example, some might only look at operating income, others might exclude allocated overhead from operating income. Another alternative is to focus on gross margin. The point is that managerial accountants must be flexible in designing reports that best meet the needs of managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p04">The president of Game Products, Inc., referred to net income when she indicated that the Board Games division performed very well for the year. Solely based on this measure, Mandy’s statement is accurate as the Board Games division has net income of $3,466,000 versus $2,306,000 for the Sporting Goods division and $1,577,000 for the Computer Games division.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Limitations of Using Segmented Income to Measure Performance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Although using net income for each division as a performance measure is relatively simple, there are two significant weaknesses. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are these weaknesses?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Answer: First, not all divisions are of equal size. Naturally, larger divisions should produce larger profits. It is unfair to compare net income for a smaller division with net income for a larger division for the purpose of evaluating division manager performance. With $34,000,000 in sales, the Board Games division should be expected to have higher net income than the other divisions, each of which has sales of less than $30,000,000.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p03">One solution is to compare profit margin ratios for each division (net income ÷ sales). As shown at the bottom of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f01">Figure 11.3 "Segmented Income Statements (Game Products, Inc.)"</a>, the Sporting Goods division has the highest profit margin ratio at 11.53 percent, compared to 10.19 percent for Board Games, and 5.44 percent for Computer Games. (<a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch13#heisinger_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "How Do Managers Use Financial and Nonfinancial Performance Measures?"</a> presents several additional financial ratios used to evaluate performance.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p04">Because each division manager has control over revenues, costs, <em class="emphasis">and investments in assets</em>, each division is considered an investment center. Thus a second weakness in using segmented net income information to evaluate division manager performance is that net income as the sole measure of performance ignores the assets used to produce net income.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p05">For example, suppose the Sporting Goods division only invested approximately $29,000,000 in assets to produce $2,306,000 in income, while the Board Games division invested $55,000,000 in assets to produce $3,466,000 in income. Which division had the best performance? We need a measure to evaluate how well each division performed relative to the investments made. We discuss three such measures next.</p>

                <li>Investment center managers are often evaluated using segment net income, which is segment revenues minus segment expenses. However, two weaknesses are that this measure does not consider the revenues required to produce segment net income, and this measure ignores the assets used to produce segment net income.</li>

                    <p class="para">The Northern division is most profitable with net income of $2,300,000 versus net income of $780,000 in the Southern division. Using net income to evaluate which division is most profitable can be misleading because it does not consider the amount of assets needed to produce income. For example, the Northern division may have invested considerably less in assets to produce net income of $780,000.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p08">Another reason this may be misleading is no consideration is given to the dollar amount of sales required to produce the net income for each division. Clearly the Northern division has significantly higher sales ($30,000,000 versus $5,000,000 for the Southern division) and therefore should have significantly higher net income.</p>

This shows that each dollar in sales at the Southern division generates more net income (15.60 cents) than at the Northern division (7.67 cents).</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p09">Organizations prefer to use the profit margin ratio when comparing segments because it serves as an equalizer in comparing divisions with significantly different levels of sales revenue.</p>
