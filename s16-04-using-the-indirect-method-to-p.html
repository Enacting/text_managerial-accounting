(The</em> direct <em class="emphasis">method is covered in the appendix.) The starting point using the indirect method is net income. Home Store, Inc., had net income of $124,000 in 2012.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p02">Answer: Several adjustments are necessary to convert this amount to a cash basis and to provide an amount related only to daily operating activities of the business. If the resulting adjusted amount is a cash inflow, it is called <em class="emphasis">cash provided by operating activities</em>; if it is a cash outflow, it is called <em class="emphasis">cash used by operating activities</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p03">Three general types of adjustments are necessary to convert net income to <em class="emphasis">cash provided by operating activities</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The first adjustment to net income involves adding back expenses that do not affect cash (often called noncash expenses). For example, the accrual basis of accounting deducts depreciation expense in calculating net income, even though depreciation expense does not involve cash. (Recall the financial accounting entry to record depreciation expense: debit depreciation expense and credit accumulated depreciation. Notice cash is not involved.) Thus to convert net income to a cash basis, depreciation expense is added back to net income. In effect, we are reversing depreciation expense because it is not an expense using the cash basis of accounting. The end result is as though depreciation expense was never deducted as an expense.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p03">Next, we show how the first adjustment to net income appears in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows for Home Store, Inc. (net income and depreciation expense come from the income statement shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>):</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is the second type of adjustment necessary to convert net income to a cash basis?</em></p>
            <p class="para block"> </p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p02">Answer: The second adjustment to net income involves adding back losses and deducting gains related to investing activities. For example, Home Store, Inc., realized a $6,000 loss on the sale of equipment. This loss is shown on the income statement as a deduction in calculating net income (see <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>). However, this loss is <em class="emphasis">not</em> related to the daily operations of the business. That is, Home Store, Inc., is not in the business of buying and selling equipment daily. Remember, we are trying to find the cash provided by <em class="emphasis">operating activities</em> in this section of the statement of cash flows.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p03">Since equipment is a <em class="emphasis">noncurrent</em> asset, cash activity related to the disposal of equipment should be included in the investment activities section of the statement of cash flows. Thus the $6,000 loss shown as a deduction on the income statement is added back to net income, and it will be included later in the investing activities section as part of the proceeds from the sale of equipment. In effect, we are reversing the $6,000 loss because it is <em class="emphasis">not</em> an operating expense.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p04">Here’s how the second adjustment to net income appears in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows for Home Store, Inc.:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p02">Answer: The third type of adjustment to net income involves analyzing the changes in all current assets (except cash) and current liabilities from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. These changes are already shown in the far right column of the balance sheet portion of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>. Two important rules must be followed to determine how the change is reflected as an adjustment to net income. Study these two rules carefully:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_l01" numeration="arabic">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Current assets.</strong> Increases in current assets are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from net income; decreases in current assets are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to net income. (There is an <em class="emphasis">inverse relationship</em> between the change in a current asset account and how it is shown as an adjustment.)</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Current liabilities.</strong> Increases in current liabilities are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to net income; decreases in current liabilities are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from net income. (There is a <em class="emphasis">direct relationship</em> between the change in a current liability account and how it is shown as an adjustment.)</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p03">Now let’s work through each current asset and current liability line item shown in the balance sheet (<a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>) and use these rules to determine how each item fits into the operating activities section as an adjustment to net income.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p04">The first current asset line item, cash, shows the change in cash from the beginning of the year to the end of year. Cash decreased by $98,000. The goal of the statement of cash flows is to show what caused this $98,000 decrease. This amount will appear in step 4 when we reconcile the beginning cash balance to the ending cash balance. The next line item is accounts receivable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Accounts receivable (current asset) increased by $60,000.</strong> The current asset rule states that increases in current assets are deducted from net income. Thus $60,000 is deducted from net income in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. Here’s why.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p06">Assume all Home Store’s sales shown on the income statement are credit sales (each sale required a debit to accounts receivable and a credit to sales). The beginning accounts receivable balance of $25,000 is increased by $900,000 for credit sales made during the year, resulting in $925,000 in total receivables to be collected. Since $85,000 in accounts receivable remains at the end of the year, $840,000 in cash was collected (= $925,000 − $85,000). On a cash basis, Home Store, Inc., should show $840,000 in revenue rather than $900,000. Thus net income must be reduced by $60,000 (= $900,000 revenue using accrual basis − $840,000 revenue using cash basis). The accounts receivable T-account shown in the following provides further clarification.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p08">We will continue analyzing each current asset and current liability item in the balance sheet shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a> and present the resulting adjustments and completed operating activities section at the end of our analysis in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_f01">Figure 12.5 "Operating Activities Section of Statement of Cash Flows (Home Store, Inc.)"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">Merchandise inventory (current asset) increased by $66,000.</strong> Because the current asset rule states that increases in current assets are deducted from net income, $66,000 is deducted from net income in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. To explain why, let’s assume Home Store, Inc., pays cash for all purchases of merchandise inventory. If the merchandise inventory account increases over time, more goods are purchased than are sold. Because merchandise inventory at Home Store, Inc., increased $66,000 and cost of goods sold totaled $546,000 (as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>), the company must have purchased inventory with a cost of $612,000 during the period (= $66,000 + $546,000). Thus more cash was paid for merchandise ($612,000) than was reflected on the income statement as cost of goods sold ($546,000). If expenses are higher using a cash basis, the adjustment must decrease net income. Therefore $66,000 is deducted from net income in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. This information is summarized in the merchandise inventory T-account in the following.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">

This is because cash paid for these expenses was lower than the expenses recognized on the income statement using the accrual basis. Since expenses are $2,000 lower using the cash basis, net income must be increased by $2,000.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p04">Second, the company sold equipment for $5,000 cash (often called a <em class="emphasis">disposal</em> of equipment).

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p07">Answer: First, the purchase of equipment for $67,000 cash is shown as a <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in cash. Second, the sale of equipment for $5,000 is shown as an <em class="emphasis">increase</em> in cash. It is not enough to simply show a cash outflow of $62,000 in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows (= $67,000 − $5,000). Instead, Home Store, Inc., must show the components of this cash outflow as separate line items in the statement of cash flows as required by U.S. GAAP. The formal presentation of this information in the investing activities section is shown later in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_f01">Figure 12.6 "Investing Activities Section of Statement of Cash Flows (Home Store, Inc.)"</a>.</p>

Thus as this accumulated depreciation account increases, it further reduces overall assets. Terminology can get confusing, so here is a simple way to look at it. The higher the account goes; the more it reduces assets. This is why the change column shows this account as decreasing assets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p09">Two items caused the change in the accumulated depreciation account. First, the sale of equipment during the year caused the company to take $10,000 in accumulated depreciation off the books. Second, $24,000 in depreciation expense was recorded during the year (with a corresponding entry to accumulated depreciation). This information is summarized in the following T-account:</p>

                <li>The statement of cash flows is prepared using the four steps described in the previous segment. In step 1, the indirect method starts with net income in the operating activities section and makes three types of adjustments to convert net income to a cash basis. The first adjustment is adding back expenses that do not affect cash, such as depreciation. The second adjustment is adding back losses and deducting gains related to investing activities. The third adjustment is adding and subtracting changes in current assets (except cash) and current liabilities using the adjustment rules. Steps 2 and 3 are done by analyzing and presenting cash activities associated with noncurrent assets (investing activities) and noncurrent liabilities and owners’ equity (financing activities). Step 4 shows that the change in cash on the statement of cash flows agrees with the change in cash on the balance sheet.</li>
