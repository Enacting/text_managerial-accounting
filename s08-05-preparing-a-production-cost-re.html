        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p02">Answer: When using information from the production cost report, managers must be careful not to assume that all production costs are variable costs. The CEO of Desk Products, Inc., Ann Watkins, was told that the Assembly department cost for each desk totaled $62 for the month of May (from <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_f01">Figure 4.9 "Production Cost Report for Desk Products’ Assembly Department"</a>, step 3). However, if the company produces more or fewer units than were produced in May, the unit cost will change. This is because the $62 unit cost includes both variable and fixed costs (see <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05#heisinger_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "How Do Organizations Identify Cost Behavior Patterns?"</a> for a detailed discussion of fixed and variable costs).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p03">Assume direct materials and direct labor are variable costs. In the Assembly department, the variable costs per unit associated with direct materials and direct labor of $50 (= $30 direct materials + $20 direct labor) will remain the same regardless of the level of production, within the relevant range. However, the remaining unit product cost of $12 associated with overhead must be analyzed further to determine the amount that is variable (e.g., indirect materials) and the amount that is fixed (e.g., factory rent). Managers must understand that fixed costs <em class="emphasis">per unit</em> will change depending on the level of production. More specifically, Ann Watkins must understand that the $62 unit cost in the Assembly department provided in the production cost report will change depending on the level of production. <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05#heisinger_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "How Do Organizations Identify Cost Behavior Patterns?"</a> provides a detailed presentation of how cost information can be separated into fixed and variable components for the purpose of providing managers with more useful information.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_l01">
                <li>The four key steps of assigning costs to units transferred out and units in ending WIP inventory are formally presented in a production cost report. The production cost report summarizes the production and cost activity within a processing department for a reporting period. A separate report is prepared for each processing department. Rounding the cost per equivalent unit to the nearest thousandth will minimize rounding differences when reconciling costs to be accounted for in step 2 with costs accounted for in step 4.</li>

However, Excel has a few basic features that can make the job of creating a production cost report easier. For example, you can use formulas to sum numbers in a column (note that each of the four steps presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_f01">Figure 4.9 "Production Cost Report for Desk Products’ Assembly Department"</a> has column totals) and to calculate the cost per equivalent unit.

The production manager is told to push his employees to get as far as possible with production, thereby increasing the percentage of completion for ending WIP inventory. However, since the production process takes three weeks to complete, all the units produced in the last half of March will be in WIP inventory at the end of March.</p>
