    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: The issue facing the president at Sportswear is a common one. Companies prefer not to disclose more information than is required by U.S. GAAP, but they would like to have more detailed information for internal decision-making and performance-evaluation purposes. This is why it is important to distinguish between financial and managerial accounting. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is the difference between information prepared by financial accountants and information prepared by managerial accountants?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">Answer: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Financial accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Provides historical financial information to external users.</span></span> focuses on providing historical financial information to external users. External users are those outside the company, including owners (e.g., shareholders) and creditors (e.g., banks or bondholders). Financial accountants reporting to external users are required to follow <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP)</a><span class="glossdef">A set of accounting rules that must be followed to provide consistency in reporting financial information to external users.</span></span>, a set of accounting rules that requires consistency in recording and reporting financial information. This information typically summarizes overall company results and does not provide detailed information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Managerial accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Focuses on internal users, including executives, product managers, sales managers, and any other personnel in the organization who use accounting information for decision making.</span></span> focuses on internal users—executives, product managers, sales managers, and any other personnel within the organization who use accounting information to make important decisions. Managerial accounting information need not conform with U.S. GAAP. In fact, conformance with U.S. GAAP may be a deterrent to getting useful information for internal decision-making purposes. For example, when establishing an inventory cost for one or more units of product (each jersey or hat produced at Sportswear Company), U.S. GAAP requires that production overhead costs, such as factory rent and factory utility costs, be included. However, for internal decision-making purposes, it might make more sense to include nonproduction costs that are directly linked to the product, such as sales commissions or administrative costs.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Question: It’s clear that financial accounting focuses on reporting to outside users while managerial accounting focuses on reporting to inside users. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What specific characteristics would we expect to see in managerial accounting information?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p05">Answer: Managerial accounting often focuses on making future projections for segments of a company. Suppose Sportswear Company is considering introducing a new line of coffee mugs with team logos on each mug. Management would certainly need detailed financial projections for sales, costs, and the resulting profits (or losses). Although historical financial accounting data from other product lines would be useful, preparing projections for the new line of mugs would be a managerial accounting function.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p06">Another characteristic of managerial accounting data is its high level of detail. As noted in the opening dialogue between the president and accountant at Sportswear Company, the financial information in the annual report provides a general overview of the company’s financial results but does not provide any detailed information about each product. Information, such as product profitability, would come from the managerial accounting function.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p07">Finally, managerial accounting information often takes the form of nonfinancial measures. For example, Sportswear Company might measure the percentage of defective products produced or the percentage of on-time deliveries to customers. This kind of nonfinancial information comes from the managerial accounting function.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The president at Sportswear, Dana Matthews, learned that the hats product line was much more profitable than expected, accounting for 55 percent of the company’s profits even though initial estimates were that the hat segment would account for 40 percent of company profits. Conversely, the jerseys product line was much less profitable than expected, accounting for 45 percent of the company’s profits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">There are many issues associated with determining product profitability, including how to allocate costs that are not easily traced to each product and whether the product revenue and cost information is accurate enough to make important managerial decisions. These important issues will be addressed throughout the book.</p>
