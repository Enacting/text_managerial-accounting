The president has informed you that if the company’s profits grow by 20 percent this year, you will receive a $20,000 bonus, and she will receive a $50,000 bonus. No bonuses will be awarded if profit growth is less than 20 percent. Because the company’s profits have grown 20 percent annually for the last 10 years, investors have come to expect significant growth from one year to the next. Near the end of this fiscal year, the president and you have the following conversation:</em></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question: The situation at Drive Write creates a serious ethical dilemma. (The Drive Write example is based on a real company called </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">MiniScribe Corporation</em><em class="emphasis">, subsequently purchased by a competitor.) Companies are constantly under pressure to meet sales and profit goals. Employees who succeed in meeting these goals often reap huge monetary rewards; those who fail may be penalized with lower pay or may even lose their jobs. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What would you do if asked to record information in a way that distorts the company’s financial results?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p03">Answer: As the accountant for Drive Write, your response to the president’s request would likely affect your reputation as a professional and your future as an accountant. The unethical behavior at corporations like <strong class="emphasis bold">Xerox</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">Enron</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">WorldCom</strong> in recent years makes it imperative that we know both how to act ethically and how to resolve ethical conflicts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p04">To help guide accounting professionals through ethical dilemmas like the one at Drive Write, the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) has established a <em class="emphasis">Statement of Ethical Professional Practice</em>, which appears in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_f01">Figure 1.2 "IMA Statement of Ethical Professional Practice"</a>. The standards outlined in this statement are guidelines that can help accountants choose an ethically acceptable course of action. As you review <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_f01">Figure 1.2 "IMA Statement of Ethical Professional Practice"</a>, notice that the IMA specifies four core responsibilities (competence, confidentiality, integrity, and credibility) as well as guidelines on how to resolve ethical conflicts. The “Resolution of Ethical Conflict” section provides specific guidance on how to resolve the conflict at Drive Write.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p06">Answer: Yes, other professional organizations do provide ethical guidance. Several are listed as follows:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_l02">
        <li>The American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has a <em class="emphasis">Code of Professional Conduct</em> (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aicpa.org">http://www.aicpa.org</a>).</li>
        <li>Financial Executives International provides a <em class="emphasis">Model Code of Ethical Conduct for Financial Managers</em> (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.financialexecutives.org">http://www.financialexecutives.org</a>).</li>
        <li>The International Federation of Accountants has a <em class="emphasis">Code of Ethics and Statement of Policy Implementation &amp; Enforcement of Ethical Requirements</em> (see http://www.ifac.org).</li>
        <li>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, requires a company to disclose whether it has adopted a code of ethics (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</a>).</li>
        <li>The Institute of Management Accountants even provides an ethics help line to give financial professionals a resource to provide guidance in making the right decisions (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imanet.org">http://www.imanet.org</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p07">Because of alleged wrongdoing, such as that reported in the <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_n02">Note 1.27 "Business in Action 1.3"</a>, improving ethics is a top priority for most businesses as shown in the <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_n03">Note 1.28 "Business in Action 1.4"</a>. As a result, professional organizations like those we have cited have become instrumental in providing ethical guidelines.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Business in Action 1.3</h3>
        <p class="simpara">Production Firm Employees Charged with Fraud</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p08">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed three actions against <strong class="emphasis bold">Diebold, Inc.</strong>, a manufacturer and seller of automated teller machines, for improperly inflating earnings over a five-year period. Three former employees—the CFO, controller, and director of accounting—were accused of improperly inflating revenue on factory orders, improperly recognizing revenue on a lease transaction, manipulating reserves and accruals, improperly capitalizing expenses, and improperly increasing the value of inventory. These actions allegedly resulted in over 40 misstated annual, quarterly, and other reports filed with the SEC, along with numerous inaccurate press releases.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p09">The company agreed to pay a $25,000,000 civil penalty, and the three former employees remain in litigation. Although the CEO was not accused of wrongdoing, he settled with the SEC and agreed to pay back cash bonuses, stock, and stock options received during the periods when the financial fraud was committed.</p>

                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Confidentiality.</strong> Members of the IMA must not disclose confidential information for any reason unless legally obligated to do so.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Integrity.</strong> Members of the IMA must avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest, including receiving gifts or favors, and must not engage in any activity that would discredit the profession.</li>

                <p class="para">Several options exist for resolving ethical conflicts. The IMA suggests the following courses of action:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_l07">
                    <li>Follow the policies of the organization involving the resolution of ethical conflicts.</li>
                    <li>If following the organization’s policies does not effectively resolve the conflict, discuss the problem with your immediate supervisor unless the supervisor is involved.</li>
                    <li>If the immediate superior cannot reach a satisfactory resolution, the problem should be presented to the next higher managerial level.</li>
                    <li>If all higher levels of management do not reach a satisfactory resolution, an acceptable reviewing authority may be a group, such as the audit committee, executive committee, board of directors, board of trustees, or owners.</li>
                    <li>Another option includes consulting an objective advisor (e.g., IMA ethics counseling service or an attorney).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Several options are available. The IMA suggests first following the organization’s policies with regard to resolving ethical conflicts. If Drive Write does not have policies in place or if following the organization’s policies does not resolve the conflict, the next step is to discuss the conflict with the immediate supervisor. However, the president of Drive Write (the immediate supervisor) is involved in the conflict, so approaching the president’s superiors would be best. This could be the audit committee, executive committee, board of directors, or owners. If after pursuing these different courses of action the ethical conflict still exists, it may be appropriate to consult an objective advisor (e.g., the IMA helpline) and perhaps consult an attorney as to legal obligations and rights concerning the ethical conflict. (Many would argue that regardless of the outcome, one would not want to work for a company where this type of unethical behavior occurs at the top, or anywhere within the organization, and that resigning is the best course of action.)</li>
