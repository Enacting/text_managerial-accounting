From what I can tell, we sell each snowboard for $250, our variable cost is $150 per unit, and our fixed cost is $75 per unit. It seems to me that if we sell just one snowboard each month, we should still show a profit of $25, and any additional units sold should increase total profit.</em></td>

Fixed costs total $50,000 a month regardless of the number of units we produce. Trying to express fixed costs on a per unit basis can be misleading because it depends on the number of units being produced and sold, which changes each month. I can tell you that each snowboard produced and sold provides $100 toward covering fixed costs—that is, $250, the sales price of one snowboard, minus $150 in variable cost.</em></td>

Is it possible to determine how many units we have to sell each month to at least cover our expenses? I’d also like to discuss what it will take to make a decent profit.</em></td>
