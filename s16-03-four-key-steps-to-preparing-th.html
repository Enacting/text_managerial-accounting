    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Recall from your financial accounting course that the accrual basis of accounting recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. Conversely, the cash basis of accounting recognizes revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid, regardless of when goods or services are exchanged. The income statement, balance sheet, and statement of owners’ equity are all created using the accrual basis of accounting. However, the statement of cash flows is based on cash flows only, and thus adjustments must be made to convert accrual basis information to a cash basis. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What information is necessary to make these adjustments?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p02">Answer: Several pieces of information are required to make these adjustments in preparing the statement of cash flows:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Balance sheets</strong> for the end of last year and end of the current year are needed to calculate the amount of change in each balance sheet account. These changes in balance sheet accounts are needed to prepare certain parts of the statement of cash flows.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Income statement</strong> information for the current year is needed as the starting point for converting net income from an accrual basis to a cash basis, which is shown in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other information</strong> is needed to complete the statement of cash flows, such as cash dividends paid and the original cost of long-term investments sold.</li>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p04">Answer: The four steps required to prepare the statement of cash flows are described as follows:</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 1. Prepare the </strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">operating activities </em><strong class="emphasis bold">section by converting net income from an accrual basis to a cash basis.</strong></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p06">This step can be done using one of two methods—the <em class="emphasis">direct</em> method or the <em class="emphasis">indirect</em> method. Because more than 98 percent of companies surveyed use the indirect method (see <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_n02">Note 12.15 "Business in Action 12.3"</a>), we will use the indirect method throughout this chapter. The appendix describes the direct method.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p07">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">indirect method</a><span class="glossdef">A statement of cash flows method that begins with net income from the income statement and makes several adjustments related to changes in current assets, current liabilities, and other items to arrive at <em class="emphasis">cash provided by (used by) operating activities.</em></span></span> begins with net income from the income statement and makes several adjustments related to changes in current assets, current liabilities, and other items to arrive at <em class="emphasis">cash provided by operating activities</em> (or <em class="emphasis">used by operating activities</em> if the result is a cash outflow). <em class="emphasis">Cash provided by operating activities</em> represents net income on a cash basis. It tells the reader how much cash was received from the daily operations of the business.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 2. Prepare the </strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">investing activities </em><strong class="emphasis bold">section by presenting cash activity for noncurrent assets.</strong></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p09">This step focuses on the effect changes in noncurrent assets have on cash. Noncurrent asset balances found on the balance sheet, coupled with other information (e.g., cash proceeds from sale of equipment) are used to perform this step.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p10"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 3. Prepare the </strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">financing activities </em><strong class="emphasis bold">section by presenting cash activity for noncurrent liabilities and owners’ equity.</strong></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p11">This step focuses on the effect changes in noncurrent liabilities and owners’ equity have on cash. Noncurrent liabilities and owners’ equity balances found on the balance sheet, coupled with other information (e.g., cash dividends paid) are used to perform this step.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p12"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 4. Reconcile the change in cash.</strong></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p13">Each section of the statement of cash flows described in steps 1, 2, and 3, will show the total cash provided by (increase) or used by (decrease) the activity. Step 4 simply confirms that the net of these changes equates to the change in cash on the balance sheet.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p14">For example, assume the balance sheet shows cash totaled $100 at the end of last year and $140 at the end of the current year. Thus cash increased $40 over the course of the current year. Step 4 reconciles this change with the changes shown in the three sections of the statement of cash flows. Suppose operating activities <em class="emphasis">provided</em> cash of $170, investing activities <em class="emphasis">used</em> cash of $160, and financing activities <em class="emphasis">provided</em> cash of $30. These 3 amounts netted together reconcile to the $40 increase in cash shown on the balance sheet (= $170 − $160 + $30).</p>

        <p class="simpara">Indirect Method Is Most Popular</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_p15">Most companies prefer to use the indirect method to prepare the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. A survey taken in 2001 showed more than 98 percent of the 600 companies surveyed used the indirect method. Reasons for this preference vary, but several possibilities are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s03_l03">
            <li>The indirect method links net income to cash flows from operating activities by reconciling the two amounts.</li>
            <li>Accounting systems do not easily generate information needed to use the direct method.</li>
            <li>Those using the direct method are also required to provide a supplemental schedule using the indirect method. It is less costly to simply prepare the statement using the indirect method.</li>
