However, the IRR provides additional information that helps companies evaluate long-term investments. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is the IRR, and how does it help managers make decisions related to long-term investments?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">internal rate of return (IRR)</a><span class="glossdef">A method used to evaluate long-term investments. It is defined as the rate required to get a net present value of zero for a series of cash flows.</span></span> is the rate required (<em class="emphasis">r</em>) to get an NPV of zero for a series of cash flows. The IRR represents the time-adjusted rate of return for the investment being considered. The <em class="emphasis">IRR decision rule</em> states that if the IRR is greater than or equal to the company’s required rate of return (recall that this is often called the <em class="emphasis">hurdle rate</em>), the investment is accepted; otherwise, the investment is rejected.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p03">Most managers use a spreadsheet, such as Excel, to calculate the IRR for an investment (we discuss this later in the chapter). However, we can also use trial and error to approximate the IRR. <em class="emphasis">The goal is simply to find the rate that generates an NPV of zero.</em> Let’s go back to the Jackson’s Quality Copies example. <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_f01">Figure 8.4 "Alternative NPV Calculation for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a> provides the projected cash flows for a new copy machine and the NPV calculation using a rate of 10 percent. Recall that the NPV was $1,250, indicating the investment generates a return greater than the company’s required rate of return of 10 percent.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p04">Although it is useful to know that the investment’s return is greater than the company’s required rate of return, managers often want to know the exact return generated by the investment. (It is often not enough to state that the exact return is something higher than 10 percent!) Managers also like to rank investment opportunities by the return each investment is expected to generate. Our goal now is to determine the exact return—that is, to determine the IRR. We know from <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_f01">Figure 8.4 "Alternative NPV Calculation for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a> that the copy machine investment generates a return greater than 10 percent. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_f01">Figure 8.5 "Finding the IRR for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a> summarizes this calculation with the 2 columns under the 10 percent heading.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p05">The far right side of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_f01">Figure 8.5 "Finding the IRR for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a> shows that the NPV is $(2,100) if the rate is increased to 12 percent (recall our goal is to find the rate that yields an NPV of 0). Thus the IRR is between 10 and 12 percent. Next, we try 11 percent. As shown in the middle of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_f01">Figure 8.5 "Finding the IRR for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a>, 11 percent provides an NPV of $(469). Thus the IRR is between 10 and 11 percent; it is closer to 11 percent because $(469) is closer to 0 than $1,250. (Note that as the rate <em class="emphasis">increases</em>, the NPV <em class="emphasis">decreases</em>, and as the rate <em class="emphasis">decreases</em>, the NPV <em class="emphasis">increases</em>.)</p>

Knowing that 15 percent results in an NPV of $(14,720), and therefore seeing the return is less than 15 percent, we decreased the rate to 13 percent. As shown in the following figure, this resulted in an NPV of $15,720, which indicates the return is higher than 13 percent. Using a rate of 14 percent results in an NPV very close to 0 at $224. Thus the IRR is close to 14 percent.</p>
