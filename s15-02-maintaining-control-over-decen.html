    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: To evaluate performance, organizations often divide operations into segments.

Responsibility centers can be based on such attributes as sales regions, product lines, or services offered. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do organizations establish responsibility centers?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_p02">Answer: The purpose of establishing responsibility centers within organizations is to hold managers responsible for only the assets, revenues, and costs they can control. For example, a factory manager typically has control over production costs, but not sales. This manager’s responsibility center would only include production costs. A retail store manager typically has control over sales prices and costs. This manager’s responsibility center would only include revenues and costs. The level of control a manager has over a segment’s assets, revenues, and costs will help determine the type of responsibility center used for each manager.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Answer: A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost center</a><span class="glossdef">A segment of an organization responsible only for costs, but <em class="emphasis">not</em> for revenue or investments in assets.</span></span> is an organizational segment that is responsible for costs, but not revenue or investments in assets. Service departments, such as accounting, marketing, computer support, and human resources, are cost centers. Managers of these departments are evaluated based on providing a certain level of services for the company at a reasonable cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p03">Production departments within a manufacturing firm are also treated as cost centers. Production managers are evaluated based on meeting cost budgets for producing a certain level of goods. <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch10#heisinger_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "How Do Managers Evaluate Performance Using Cost Variance Analysis?"</a> describes the use of cost variance analysis to evaluate cost centers within a manufacturing firm.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p02">Answer: A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">profit center</a><span class="glossdef">A segment of an organization responsible for costs and revenues, but <em class="emphasis">not</em> investments in assets.</span></span> is an organizational segment that is responsible for costs and revenues (and therefore, profit), but not investments in assets. Retail stores for companies, such as <strong class="emphasis bold">Macy’s</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">Kmart</strong>, are treated as profit centers. Individual fast food restaurants for <strong class="emphasis bold">McDonald’s</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">Kentucky Fried Chicken</strong> are also examples of profit centers. Managers of profit centers are responsible for revenues, costs, and resulting profits. (Some individual retail stores and fast food restaurants may be considered investment centers if the store manager is also responsible for large investment decisions, such as enlarging the building and purchasing more equipment to accommodate additional customers. Profit center determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, and it depends on the level of responsibility assigned to the store manager.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p03">Methods of performance evaluation for profit centers vary. Some organizations compare actual profit to budgeted profit. Others compare one profit center to another. Also, some organizations use segmented income statement ratios, such as gross margin or operating profit, to compare current profit center performance to prior periods and to other profit centers. <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch13#heisinger_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "How Do Managers Use Financial and Nonfinancial Performance Measures?"</a> explains how companies can use financial ratios to evaluate profit center performance.</p>

Investment center managers have control over asset investment decisions. In many cases, investment centers are treated as stand-alone businesses. Examples of investment centers include the Chevrolet division of <strong class="emphasis bold">General Motors</strong> and the printer division of <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p03">Several measures can be used to evaluate the performance of investment center managers, including <em class="emphasis">segmented net income</em>, <em class="emphasis">ROI</em>, <em class="emphasis">RI</em>, and <em class="emphasis">economic value added (EVA)</em>.
