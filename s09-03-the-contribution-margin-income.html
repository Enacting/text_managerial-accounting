    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p01">After further work with her staff, Susan was able to break down the selling and administrative costs into their variable and fixed components. (This process is the same as the one we discussed earlier for production costs.) Susan then established the cost equations shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_t01">Table 5.5 "Cost Equations for Bikes Unlimited"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question: The challenge now is to organize this information in a way that is helpful to management—specifically, to Eric Mendez. The traditional income statement format used for external financial reporting simply breaks costs down by functional area: cost of goods sold and selling and administrative costs. It does not show fixed and variable costs. Panel A of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a> illustrates the traditional format. (We defer consideration of income taxes to the end of <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch06#heisinger_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "How Is Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis Used for Decision Making?"</a>.) </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can this information be presented in an income statement that shows fixed and variable costs separately?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p03">Answer: Another income statement format, called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contribution margin income statement</a><span class="glossdef">An income statement used for internal reporting that shows fixed and variable cost information.</span></span>, shows the fixed and variable components of cost information. This type of statement appears in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a>. Note that operating profit is the same in both statements, but the organization of data differs. The contribution margin income statement organizes the data in a way that makes it easier for management to assess how changes in production and sales will affect operating profit. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contribution margin</a><span class="glossdef">Sales revenue left over after deducting variable costs from sales.</span></span> represents sales revenue left over after deducting variable costs from sales. It is the amount remaining that will <em class="emphasis">contribute</em> to covering fixed costs and to operating profit (hence, the name <em class="emphasis">contribution margin</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p04">Eric indicated that sales volume in August could increase by 20 percent over sales in June of 5,000 units, which would increase unit sales to 6,000 units [= 5,000 units + (5,000 × 20 percent)], and he asked Susan to come up with projected profit for August. Eric also mentioned that the sales price would remain the same at $100 per unit. Using this information and the cost estimate equations in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_t01">Table 5.5 "Cost Equations for Bikes Unlimited"</a>, Susan prepared the contribution margin income statement in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a>. Assume for now that 6,000 units is just within the relevant range for Bikes Unlimited. (We will discuss this assumption later in the chapter.)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p05">The contribution margin income statement shown in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a> clearly indicates which costs are variable and which are fixed. Recall that the variable cost <em class="emphasis">per unit</em> remains constant, and variable costs <em class="emphasis">in total</em> change in proportion to changes in activity. Because 6,000 units are expected to be sold in August, total variable costs are calculated by multiplying 6,000 units by the cost per unit ($53.42 per unit for cost of goods sold, and $9.00 per unit for selling and administrative costs). Thus total <em class="emphasis">variable</em> cost of goods sold is $320,520, and total <em class="emphasis">variable</em> selling and administrative costs are $54,000. These two amounts are combined to calculate total variable costs of $374,520, as shown in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p06">The contribution margin of $225,480 represents the sales revenue left over after deducting variable costs from sales ($225,480 = $600,000 − $374,520). It is the amount remaining that will <em class="emphasis">contribute</em> to covering fixed costs and to operating profit.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p07">Recall that total fixed costs remain constant regardless of the level of activity. Thus <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> cost of goods sold remains at $43,276, and <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> selling and administrative costs stay at $110,000. This holds true at both the 5,000 unit level of activity for June, and the 6,000 unit level of activity projected for August. Total fixed costs of $153,276 (= $43,276 + $110,000) are deducted from the contribution margin to calculate operating profit of $72,204.</p>

Refer to panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a> as you read Susan’s comments about the contribution margin income statement.</p>
