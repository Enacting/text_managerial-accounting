    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_p01">Jerry Feltz is the president and owner of Jerry’s Ice Cream, a producer of high-quality ice cream sold to specialty grocery stores. Jerry is holding a meeting with the company’s managers to discuss plans for this coming year. Managers at the meeting are Tom Benson, the sales manager; Lynn Young, the production manager; and Michelle Hopkins, the treasurer and controller.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_p02">Many companies encounter the same issue of growing sales that is facing Jerry’s Ice Cream. Those that <em class="emphasis">plan</em> for growth have a better chance of succeeding than those that sit idle and hope it all works out. Operating budgets are used to (1) plan operations and (2) control operations. We describe both of these objectives next and then devote the remainder of this chapter to the planning phase by creating an operating budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream. We cover the control phase in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch10#heisinger_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "How Do Managers Evaluate Performance Using Cost Variance Analysis?"</a>.</p>
