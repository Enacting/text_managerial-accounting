    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s09_p01">This chapter has focused on performing variance analysis to evaluate and control operations. Standard costing systems assist in this process and often involve recording transactions using standard cost information. When accountants use a standard costing system to record transactions, companies are able to quickly identify variances. In addition, inventory and related cost of goods sold are valued using standard cost information, which simplifies the bookkeeping process.</p>

An example of each is shown next. (Typically, many more journal entries would be made throughout the year for direct materials.

Unfavorable variances are recorded as debits and favorable variances are recorded as credits. Variance accounts are temporary accounts that are closed out at the end of the financial reporting period. We show the process of closing out variance accounts at the end of this appendix.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s09_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: As discussed in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a>, the manufacturing overhead account is debited for all actual overhead expenditures and credited when overhead is applied to products. At the end of the period, the balance in manufacturing overhead, representing overapplied or underapplied overhead, is closed out to cost of goods sold. This overapplied or underapplied balance can be explained by combining the four overhead variances summarized in this chapter in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s08#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s08_s03_f01">Figure 10.14 "Comparison of Variable and Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How are these variances recorded for transactions related to manufacturing overhead?</em></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s09_s03_p03">The credit goes to several different accounts depending on the nature of the expenditure. For example, if the expenditure is for indirect materials, the credit goes to accounts payable. If the expenditure is for indirect labor, the credit goes to wages payable.</p>
