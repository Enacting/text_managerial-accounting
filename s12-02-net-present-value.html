    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p03">Recall the problem facing Jackson’s Quality Copies at the beginning of the chapter. The company’s president and owner, Julie Jackson, would like to purchase a new copy machine. Julie feels the investment is worthwhile because the cash inflows over the copier’s life total $82,000, and the cash outflows total $57,000, resulting in net cash inflows of $25,000 (= $82,000 – $57,000). However, this approach ignores the timing of the cash flows. We know from the previous section that the further into the future the cash flows occur, the lower the value in today’s dollars.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p15">Answer: Although managers often estimate the interest rate, this estimate is typically based on the organization’s <em class="emphasis">cost of capital</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost of capital</a><span class="glossdef">The weighted average costs associated with debt and equity used to fund long-term investments.</span></span> is the weighted average costs associated with debt and equity used to fund long-term investments. The cost of debt is simply the interest rate associated with the debt (e.g., interest for bank loans or bonds issued). The cost of equity is more difficult to determine and represents the return required by owners of the organization. The weighted average of these two sources of capital represents the cost of capital (finance textbooks address the complexities of this calculation in more detail).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p16">The general rule is the higher the risk of the investment, the higher the required rate of return (assume <em class="emphasis">required rate of return</em> is synonymous with <em class="emphasis">interest rate</em> for the purpose of calculating the NPV). A firm evaluating a long-term investment with risk similar to the firm’s average risk will typically use the cost of capital. However, if a long-term investment carries higher than average risk for the firm, the firm will use a required rate of return higher than the cost of capital.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p17">The accountant at Jackson’s Quality Copies, Mike Haley, has established the cost of capital for the firm at 10 percent. Since the proposed purchase of a copy machine is of average risk to the company, Mike will use 10 percent as the required rate of return.</p>

If the NPV is zero, the rate of return from the investment equals the required rate of return. If the NPV is less than zero, the rate of return from the investment is less than the required rate of return. Since the NPV is greater than zero for Jackson’s Quality Copies, the investment is generating a return greater than the company’s required rate of return of 10 percent.</p>

                <li>Present value calculations tell us the value of cash flows in today’s dollars. The NPV method adds the present value of all cash inflows and subtracts the present value of all cash outflows related to a long-term investment. If the NPV is greater than or equal to zero, accept the investment; otherwise, reject the investment.</li>
