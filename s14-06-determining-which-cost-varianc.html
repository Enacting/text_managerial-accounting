    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p02">Answer: Managers typically establish criteria to determine which variances to focus on rather than simply investigating all variances.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p04">Answer: Some managers might review all unfavorable variances. However, the variable overhead spending variance of $5,500 is not very significant relative to the other variances and may not be worth investigating. Also, by focusing solely on unfavorable variances, managers might overlook problems that may result from favorable variances.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p05">Another approach might be to investigate all favorable and unfavorable variances above a certain minimum level, calculated as a percent of the flexible budget amount. For example, management could establish a policy to investigate all variances at or above 10 percent of the flexible budget amount for each cost. At Jerry’s Ice Cream, this would mean investigating all variances at or above $42,000 for direct materials (= 10 percent × $420,000), $27,300 for direct labor (= 10 percent × $273,000), and $10,500 for variable overhead (= 10 percent × $105,000). Based on this policy, the following variances would be investigated:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_l02">
        <li>Unfavorable direct materials price variance of $88,000 (≥ $42,000 minimum)</li>
        <li>Unfavorable direct labor rate variance of $37,800 (≥ $27,300 minimum)</li>
        <li>Favorable direct labor efficiency variance of $(27,300) (≥ $27,300 minimum)</li>
        <li>Favorable variable overhead efficiency variance of $(10,500) (≥ $10,500 minimum)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p06">Many companies calculate and investigate variances weekly, monthly, or quarterly and focus on trends. In this case, they may only investigate variances that are unfavorable and increasing over time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p07">Whatever the approach, managers understand that investigating variances requires resources. Thus managers must establish an efficient and cost-effective approach to analyzing variances by weighing the benefits derived from investigating variances against the costs incurred to perform the analysis.</p>

        <p class="simpara">Using Cost Variances to Detect Fraud</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p08">Variance analysis is not only an effective way to control costs; some companies, including <strong class="emphasis bold">The Dow Chemical Company</strong>, have found that investigating variances can also help them detect fraudulent activities. <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow</strong>, which provides chemical, plastic, and agricultural products to customers in 180 countries, has annual sales of $33,000,000,000 and approximately 46,000 employees. In 1998, the company created a department called Fraud Investigative Services (FIS) whose mission is to “deter and prevent incidents of fraud and financial abuse through detection, investigation, and education.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p09">The most common types of fraud allegations reviewed by <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow’s</strong> FIS include expense report fraud, kickback schemes, and embezzlement. Paul Zikmund, the director of FIS, states that “unexplainable cost variances between budget and actual amounts” are among the warning signs he looks for in identifying fraud.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p10">For example, suppose the actual cost for direct materials is significantly higher than the budgeted cost. The cost accountant at <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow</strong> would begin investigating the cause of the variance by talking with the company’s purchasing agent. The purchasing agent might be unable (or unwilling) to explain why actual costs are so high. Further investigation might indicate that the purchasing agent was intentionally overbilling the vendor and receiving a kickback from the vendor.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p11">Zikmund states that for every $1 that <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow</strong> spends on investigating fraud, the company recovers nearly $4. He also notes that <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow’s</strong> loss per employee is far below the industry average of $9 per employee per day. For a company with 46,000 employees, every dollar in savings per employee adds up to a significant amount.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_l03">
            <li>Companies often establish criteria to use in determining which variances to investigate. Some might investigate all variances above a certain dollar amount. Others might investigate variances that are above a certain percentage of the flexible budget. Or management might combine the two and investigate variances above a certain dollar amount and above a certain percentage of the flexible budget.</li>
