        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require the allocation of all manufacturing costs to products for inventory costing purposes. The choice of an allocation method is not critical to this process. Companies that use direct labor hours, machine hours, activity-based costing, or some other method to allocate overhead costs to products are likely to be in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Throughout this chapter, we have illustrated how ABC is used to allocate manufacturing overhead costs. However, organizations often use ABC for purposes that go beyond allocating costs solely for external reporting. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How might ABC be used to help companies in areas other than external reporting?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_p02">Answer: Commissions paid to sales people for the sale of specific products (often called <em class="emphasis">selling, general, and administrative</em>) are included as an operating expense in financial reports prepared for external users as required by U.S. GAAP. However, many organizations may assign commission costs to specific products for internal decision-making purposes. This treatment is not in compliance with U.S. GAAP, but it is perfectly acceptable for internal reporting purposes and may be done using activity-based costing. It is important to understand that managers have ultimate control over which costs should be allocated to products for internal reporting purposes, and this allocation often involves going beyond overhead costs.</p>

If management chooses to allocate service department costs to production departments as described here, there must be some benefit to going through the process. Should these costs be assigned to activity cost pools for the purpose of costing products (activity-based costing)? Should production department managers be evaluated based on the use of these services? Should actual service department usage be compared to budgeted usage for each production department? The answers to these questions vary from one organization to the next. However, one point is certain—the benefits of implementing this allocation system must outweigh the costs!</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s06_s04_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: The hierarchy of costs is not the only approach organizations use to group costs. Managers are also concerned about measuring the costs associated with quality. Quality-related costs can be organized into four categories. The first two categories—prevention and appraisal—are costs incurred to control and improve quality. The final two categories—internal failure and external failure—are costs incurred as a result of failing to control and improve quality. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is the difference between these cost categories, and how does this information help managers improve quality?</em></p>

<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Prevention costs</a><span class="glossdef">Costs for activities that prevent defects in products and services.</span></span> are costs incurred to prevent defects in products and services. Examples include designing production processes that minimize defects, providing quality training to employees, and inspecting raw materials before they are placed in production.</li>
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Appraisal costs</a><span class="glossdef">Costs for activities that detect defective products before they are delivered to customers.</span></span> (often called <em class="emphasis">detection costs</em>) are costs incurred to detect defective products before they are delivered to customers. The cost of finished goods inspections falls in this category.</li>
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internal failure costs</a><span class="glossdef">Costs incurred as a result of detecting defective products before they are delivered to customers.</span></span> are the costs incurred as a result of detecting defective products before they are delivered to customers. Examples include the reworking of defective products, the scrapping of defective products, and the machine downtime resulting from process problems that cause defects.</li>
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">External failure costs</a><span class="glossdef">Costs for activities that result from delivering defective products to customers.</span></span> are the costs incurred as a result of delivering defective products to customers.

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s06_s04_p02">Companies that measure these costs of quality typically calculate the costs in each category as a percent of total revenue. The goal is to steadily shift costs toward the prevention and appraisal categories and away from the internal and external failure categories. As organizations concentrate more on preventing defects, total quality costs as a percent of revenue tends to decline and product quality improves. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s06_s04_t01">Table 3.3 "Summary of Quality Costs"</a> provides a summary of the four classifications of quality-related costs.</p>

                <li>Activity-based costing is not simply used to allocate manufacturing overhead costs to products for external reporting purposes; it is also often used to allocate selling, general, and administrative costs to products for internal decision-making purposes. A number of methods can be used to assist in the cost allocation process. For example, the cost of service departments can be allocated to production departments using the direct method. Also the cost hierarchy can be used to help establish cost pools and identify cost drivers used to allocate costs. Organizations are also concerned with measuring and reducing the cost of quality by categorizing quality costs into four categories—prevention, appraisal, internal failure, and external failure.</li>

Management’s intent was to provide a service to our employees that would improve productivity and reward employees for their hard work. If you tell your employees to stop using the cafeteria, more costs will be allocated to other departments, and the other departments might also stop using the cafeteria. My belief is that the cafeteria will be self-sufficient within a year if more employees are encouraged to use it. This translates into no more cost allocations to departments within a year. I’ll discuss your concerns with top management later this week.”</p>
