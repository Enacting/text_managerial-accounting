            <li>Understand ethical issues associated with budgeting.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Although bottom-up budgeting, in which management elicits input from employees throughout the company, is effective in actively engaging those who have to achieve the budgeted goals, this type of budgeting is not free from problems. Ethical issues often arise in the budgeting process, particularly when employees and managers are evaluated by comparing their actual results to the budget. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How might ethical issues arise in the budgeting process?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p02">Answer: To demonstrate how ethical dilemmas might arise, assume you are a manager and you help upper management establish the master budget (this is the planning phase). Furthermore, you are evaluated based on achieving budgeted profit on a quarterly basis (this is the control phase). In fact, you will receive a $10,000 quarterly bonus, in addition to your base salary, if you meet or exceed budgeted profit. There is an inherent conflict between the planning and control phases of this process. You are helping the company plan, but you also want to be sure budgeted profit is as low as possible so you can get the $10,000 bonus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p03">Establishing a sales and profit budget that is considerably lower than what will likely happen causes problems for the entire organization. Production may be short of materials and labor, causing inefficiencies in the production process. Selling and administrative support may be lacking due to underestimating sales. Customers will not be satisfied if they must wait for the product. The dilemma you face as a manager in this situation is whether to do what is best for you (set a low profit estimate to earn the bonus) or do what is best for the company (estimate accurately so the budget reflects true sales and production needs).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p04">Organizations must recognize this conflict and have processes in place to ensure both the interests of individual employees and the interests of the organization as a whole are served. For example, employees can be rewarded not just for meeting goals but also for providing accurate estimates. Perhaps a long-term stock option incentive system would provide motivation to do what is best for the organization, thereby increasing shareholder value. Whatever incentive system is implemented, organizations must promote honest employee input and beware of fraudulent reporting to achieve financial targets.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_l02">
            <li>An inherent conflict often exists between the planning and control phases of budgeting. During the planning phase, organizations are most concerned about getting accurate estimates that lead to positive results. The control phase requires evaluating performance of employees by comparing actual results to the operating budget. Employees often must decide between doing what is best for the individual employee and what is best for the organization.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Review Problem 9.9</h3>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p05">Assume you are the manager of the computer division of High Tech Retail, Inc. You are asked to help the company prepare a budgeted income statement for the computer division before the start of each fiscal year. At the completion of each fiscal year, division managers receive a bonus equal to 10 percent of actual net income in excess of budgeted net income.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p06">Describe the ethical conflict facing you as division manager when asked to help create the budgeted income statement for your division.</p>
        <p class="simpara">Solution to Review Problem 9.9</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p07">Employees who are evaluated in the control phase by comparing actual results to budgeted information have an incentive to create a budget that is easy to achieve, and perhaps unrealistic. This can create problems for the organization as a whole since inventory purchases are made based on budgeted sales. If each of the division managers submits a sales budget that significantly underestimates sales, the company will likely have a shortage of inventory and lose out on sales as customers go elsewhere to find the product. Although the managers will have an easier time achieving sales and profit goals, the company as a whole will suffer. The ethical dilemma of choosing between doing what is best for the division manager and what is best for the organization can ultimately lead to lower sales and dissatisfied customers.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Production Budget.</strong> Schwartz and Company expects to sell 100 units in the first quarter and 90 units in the second quarter. Assuming the company prefers to maintain finished goods inventory equal to 10 percent of the next quarter’s sales, prepare a production budget for the first quarter using <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Production Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a> as a guide.

Each unit requires 10 pounds of direct materials at a cost of $2 per pound. The company prefers to maintain raw materials inventory equal to 20 percent of next quarter’s materials needed in production.

Carol believes growth in sales this year will be approximately 12 percent. She is considering submitting a budget showing an increase of 5 percent, which will increase her chances of receiving a significant bonus at the end of this coming year. Assume cost of goods sold are variable costs and will increase in proportion with sales revenue. That is, cost of goods sold will always be 60 percent of sales revenue. Assume selling and administrative expenses are fixed costs.</p>
