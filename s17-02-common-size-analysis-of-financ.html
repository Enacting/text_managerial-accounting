Income statement items are stated as a percent of net sales, and balance sheet items are stated as a percent of total assets (or total liabilities and shareholders’ equity); also called vertical analysis.</span></span> (also called <em class="emphasis">vertical analysis</em>) converts each line of financial statement data to an easily comparable, or common-size, amount measured as a percent. This is done by stating income statement items as a percent of net sales and balance sheet items as a percent of total assets (or total liabilities and shareholders’ equity). For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> had net income of $11,809,000,000 and net sales of $35,119,000,000 for 2010. The common-size percent is simply net income divided by net sales, or 33.6 percent (= $11,809 ÷ $35,119).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_p03">There are two reasons to use common-size analysis: (1) to evaluate information from one period to the next within a company and (2) to evaluate a company relative to its competitors. Common-size analysis answers such questions as “how do our current assets as a percent of total assets compare with last year?” and “how does our net income as a percent of net sales compare with that of our competitors?”</p>

As you look at these figures, notice that net sales are used as the base for the income statement, and total assets (or total liabilities and shareholders’ equity) are used as the base for the balance sheet. That is, for the income statement, each item is measured as a percent of net sales, and for the balance sheet, each item is measured as a percent of total assets (or total liabilities and shareholders’ equity).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p03">In general, managers prefer expenses as a percent of net sales to <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> over time, and profit figures as a percent of net sales to <em class="emphasis">increase</em> over time. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_f01">Figure 13.5 "Common-Size Income Statement Analysis for "</a>, <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola’s</strong> gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 2009 to 2010 (64.2 percent versus 63.9 percent). Operating income declined as well (26.6 percent versus 24.1 percent). Income before taxes increased significantly from 28.6 percent in 2009 to 40.4 percent in 2010, again mainly due to a one-time gain of $4,978,000,000 in 2010. This caused net income to increase as well, from 22.0 percent in 2009 to 33.6 percent in 2010. In the expense category, cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased, as did other operating expenses, interest expense, and income tax expense. Selling and administrative expenses increased from 36.7 percent in 2009 to 37.5 percent in 2010.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p04">Common-size analysis enables us to compare companies on equal ground, and as this analysis shows, <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> is outperforming <strong class="emphasis bold">PepsiCo</strong> in terms of income statement information.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p05">Common-size analysis is obviously crucial to comparative analysis. In fact, some sources of industry data present the information exclusively in a common-size format, and most of the accounting software available today has been engineered to facilitate this type of analysis.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p06">Most accounting computer programs, including QuickBooks, Peachtree, and MAS 90, provide common-size analysis reports. You simply select the appropriate report format and financial statement date, and the system prints the report. Thus accountants using this type of software can focus more on analyzing common-size information than on preparing it.</p>
