    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Custom Furniture Company’s direct materials include items such as wood and hardware. Direct labor involves the employees who build the custom tables. Manufacturing overhead includes items such as indirect materials (glue, screws, nails, sandpaper, and stain), indirect labor (production supervisor), and other manufacturing costs, such as factory equipment maintenance and factory utilities. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What accounts are used to record the costs associated with these items, and where do these accounts appear in the financial statements?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_p02">Answer: All the costs mentioned previously for Custom Furniture are product costs (also called <em class="emphasis">manufacturing costs</em>). Product costs are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet until the products are sold, at which point the costs are recorded as an expense on the income statement. To record product costs as an asset, accountants use one of three inventory accounts: raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, or finished goods inventory. The account they use depends on the product’s level of completion. They use one expense account—cost of goods sold—to record the product costs when the goods are sold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_p03"><a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_t01">Table 1.4 "Accounts Used to Record Product Costs"</a> summarizes the accounts used to track product costs. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_f01">Figure 1.6 "Flow of Product Costs through Balance Sheet and Income Statement Accounts"</a> shows how product costs flow through the balance sheet and income statement. Lastly, <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_n01">Note 1.57 "Business in Action 1.7"</a> provides an example of how the accounts shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_t01">Table 1.4 "Accounts Used to Record Product Costs"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_f01">Figure 1.6 "Flow of Product Costs through Balance Sheet and Income Statement Accounts"</a> appear in financial statements. Take time to review these items carefully. Your understanding of them will help clarify how product costs flow through the accounts and where product costs appear in the financial statements. The following discussion provides further clarification.</p>
