    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p02">Answer: Although these systems have marked differences, they are also similar in many ways. (As you read through this section, refer to <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a> for a review of important terms if necessary.) Recall the three inventory accounts that accountants use to track product cost information—raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods inventory. These three inventory accounts are used to record product cost information for both process costing and job costing systems. However, several work-in-process inventory accounts are typically used in a process costing system to track the flow of product costs through each production <em class="emphasis">department</em>. Thus each department has its own work-in-process inventory account. (For the purposes of this chapter, assume each department represents a production <em class="emphasis">process</em>. This explains the term <em class="emphasis">process costing</em> because we are tracking costs by process.) The sum of all work-in-process inventory accounts represents total work in process for the company.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p03">Recall the three components of product costs—direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Assigning these product costs to individual products remains an important goal for process costing, just as with job costing. However, instead of assigning product costs to individual <em class="emphasis">jobs</em> (shown on a job cost sheet), process costing assigns these costs to departments (shown on a departmental production cost report).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p04"><a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "A Comparison of Cost Flows for Job Costing and Process Costing"</a> shows how product costs flow through accounts for job costing and process costing systems. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_t01">Table 4.1 "A Comparison of Process Costing and Job Costing"</a> outlines the similarities and differences between these two costing systems. Review these illustrations carefully before moving on to the next section.</p>

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Coca-Cola Company</strong> is one of the world’s largest producers of nonalcoholic beverages. According to the company, more than 11,000 of its soft drinks are consumed every second of every day.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p06">In the first stage of production, <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> mixes direct materials—water, refined sugar, and secret ingredients—to make the liquid for its beverages. The second stage includes filling cleaned and sanitized bottles before placing a cap on each bottle. In the third stage, filled bottles are inspected, labeled, and packaged.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p07">Work in process begins with the first stage of production (mixing and blending), continues with the second stage (bottling), and ends with the third stage (inspecting, labeling, and packaging). When products have gone through all three stages of production, they are shipped to a warehouse, and the costs are entered into finished goods inventory. Once products are delivered to retail stores, product costs are transferred from finished goods inventory to cost of goods sold.</p>
