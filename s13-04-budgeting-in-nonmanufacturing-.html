    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_p01">The examples used thus far to describe a master budget have been limited to manufacturing companies. Manufacturing companies tend to have comprehensive operating budgets and therefore serve as a good starting point in learning how to develop a master budget. However, all types of organizations use operating budgets.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Answer: Merchandising organizations typically purchase finished goods and sell them to retail or wholesale customers. Because merchandisers do not produce goods, they do not use production or production-related budgets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p03"><a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_f01">Figure 9.13 "Master Budget Schedules for a Merchandising Organization"</a> provides an overview of the master budget schedules for a merchandising organization. If you compare this diagram with <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02_f01">Figure 9.1 "Master Budget Schedules"</a> (master budget schedules for a manufacturing company), you will notice that production and production-related budgets are not applicable to merchandising organizations. Direct materials are not needed, and all labor and overhead costs are included in the selling and administrative budget.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p04">The most important aspect of budgeting for merchandising organizations is the merchandise purchases budget. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">merchandise purchases budget</a><span class="glossdef">An estimate of the units of merchandise to be purchased and the cost per unit.</span></span> estimates the units of merchandise to be purchased and the cost per unit. Much like the production budget for a manufacturing company, the merchandise purchases budget estimates units to be purchased (instead of units to be produced) and is based on sales projections, as well as an estimate of desired ending merchandise inventory less beginning merchandise inventory.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Service Organizations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What do operating budgets look like for service organizations?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Answer: Service organizations, such as architectural and accounting firms, provide services rather than tangible goods. These organizations do not have raw materials, finished goods, or merchandise inventories, and therefore they do not have production or merchandise purchases budgets. Instead, the focus is on projected sales revenue from services provided and the labor necessary to achieve sales revenue projections. Service organizations must constantly estimate services to be provided and make sure labor force resources are available to meet customer demand.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Not-for-Profit Organizations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Not-for-profit organizations, such as school districts and charitable organizations, also use budgets for planning and control purposes. The budgeting process in most not-for-profit organizations is critical because the approved budget often serves as the legal authority for expenditures. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What do operating budgets look like for not-for-profit organizations?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p02">Answer: Because not-for-profit organizations are very diverse in nature—for example, some provide a service, while others collect money to help victims of natural disasters or to promote medical research—it is difficult to generalize about which master budget components apply and which do not. However, with an understanding of the budget components used by manufacturing, merchandising, and service organizations, one can establish a budgeting process for virtually any not-for-profit organization. For an example of how one not-for-profit organization goes about the budgeting process, read <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_n01">Note 9.35 "Business in Action 9.3"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p03">Yearly, a small not-for-profit symphony in California establishes an operating budget with revenues totaling $200,000. The symphony’s treasurer oversees the budget committee, which is made up of three board members. The budget committee is responsible for creating, approving, and monitoring the budget.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p04">The budget committee begins the budgeting process by reviewing information from the year before. All board members and office staff are given spreadsheets showing last year’s results and are asked to provide input for the next budget period. For example, the committee responsible for ticket sales estimates sales revenue based on expected ticket sales times the average sales price. Anticipated increases in sales price are considered in the sales budget.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p05">Expenses are also budgeted based on last year’s actual results. Those requesting increases in budgeted expenditures must justify them. Once revenues and expenses are established for the next budget period, the bookkeeper enters the information using QuickBooks software and prints a preliminary budget report, which the budget committee reviews. Once the budget committee has balanced the budget, reviewed it for reasonableness, and approved it, it goes to the board of directors for approval.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p06">The control phase of the budgeting process requires that all expenditures be in accordance with the budget. Any expenditure exceeding the budget by more than $25 must be approved by the board of directors. A financial report comparing <em class="emphasis">actual</em> revenues and expenditures with <em class="emphasis">budgeted</em> revenues and expenditures (produced using QuickBooks software) is submitted to the board of directors monthly.</p>
