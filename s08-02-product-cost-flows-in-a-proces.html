    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s02_p01">As products physically move through the production process, the product costs associated with these products move through several important accounts as shown back in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "A Comparison of Cost Flows for Job Costing and Process Costing"</a>. In this section, we present a detailed look at how product costs flow through accounts using a process costing system. Later in the chapter, we explain how dollar amounts are established for product costs that flow through the accounts. As you review each of the following cost flows for a process costing system, remember that product costs are now tracked by <em class="emphasis">department</em> rather than by <em class="emphasis">job</em>.</p>

The gum produced by these factories is sold in 150 countries. According to <strong class="emphasis bold">Wrigley Company</strong>, 50 percent of Americans chew gum, and on average, each person consumes 190 sticks per year. The number drops to 130 sticks per person in the United Kingdom and to 100 sticks per person in Taiwan.</p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Mixing.</strong> The melted base is poured into a mixer, to which sweeteners and flavors are added.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Rolling.</strong> A large “loaf” of gum is sent through a series of rollers, thereby reducing thickness to the desired size.</li>
                <li>
