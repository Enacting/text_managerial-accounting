    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s02_p02">Answer: We use financial information for the month of May at Custom Furniture Company to illustrate how a job costing system works. Refer to <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a>, as needed, for a refresher on manufacturing cost terms and how the three different inventory accounts are used by manufacturing companies.

Conversely, the following account categories are <em class="emphasis">increased</em> with a <em class="emphasis">credit</em> (and decreased with a debit): liabilities, stockholders’ equity, and revenues.
